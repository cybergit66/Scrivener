            <Text>Genesis 43

No young men have ever needed to undergo change any more than Joseph’s brothers. They desperately needed to change; they needed to be totally converted into new men. It was this that Joseph was after. Their conversion was the very reason he had put them under the test and experience they were now facing.
They had no choice but to go through the experiences covered in this chapter. If they wished food and if they wished to free Simeon, they had to return to Egypt with Benjamin. Thus they were forced into the experiences that were to change their hearts and lives forever.
At one time or another, a believer faces all of these experiences through his life. The believer should never shrink from such experiences. Most people do, but they should not, for they are tremendous learning experiences. In fact, the experiences that change our lives are experiences given by God to help us live a life that just overflows with all the fullness of life.

Jacob’s family faced severe famine and hunger: they faced problems squarely in the face (1–2).

1. What request did Jacob make? Why? Who responded, and what did he say? (v. 1-5)

Jacob told his sons to return to Egypt to buy food because they had eaten all the grain 
Jacob and his sons did not want to face this problem of the famine. Why? Because the sons were facing the possibility of being executed as spies if they returned to Egypt. 
And Jacob was facing the problem of having to send his youngest son, Benjamin, to Egypt to prove that the other sons were not lying. 
Therefore, they just kept delaying and delaying their return to Egypt. They kept putting off the trip despite Simeon’s being left back in prison. This shows how much they feared for their lives and dreaded having to face the governor
Moreover, their father was questioning the wisdom of Benjamin’s returning with them, and they dare not return without him.
But eventually, they could wait no longer.
Thought Too many of us have difficulty facing problems. When some problem confronts us, there is a tendency to procrastinate, ignore, and put it off; a tendency to hope that it will just go away or that someone else will handle it. But putting problems off can cause all kinds of difficulties for us, difficulties such as …
• strain
• stress
• anxiety
• disapproval
• blame
• confusion
• chaos
• great loss
If we have difficulty facing problems, we need to ask God to help us. We need God to strengthen us so that we can face our problems squarely in the face and conquer them. This is one way to change our lives: facing problems squarely in the face and calling upon the Lord to help us conquer them
Judah responded that they could not return without Benjamin 
From this point on Judah becomes the leader of his brothers (cf. 44:14–34; 46:28). His tribe will become preeminent among the sons of Israel (49:8–10; Matt. 1:2, 17; Luke 3:23, 33).
Judah is the oldest son in good standing with his father (cf. 34:30; 35:22).
Judah’s point was this: if they went to Egypt without Benjamin, the governor would assume they were lying and were spies. He would most definitely have them executed or imprisoned. Therefore, the sons had to prove they were telling the truth and not lying. If Jacob would let Benjamin go, they would go. If not, they could not go. There would be no need; they would be executed.
The onus is now put on Jacob. Will he consign his family to starvation, and lose Benjamin anyway? Or is he willing to release Benjamin and take his chances? Vv. 11ff. will answer that question.
they had to face their problem (the test) squarely in the face. They either had to return to Egypt to prove their innocence or else face starvation and the loss of everything they owned.
Note this: the sons had been lying and deceiving people all throughout their lives. Years before, they had lied and deceived the people of Shechem. In addition, they had lied to Jacob about Joseph (Ge. 37:31–35). This was the problem that Joseph was dealing with by making his brothers prove their word, that they actually did have a younger brother. They needed to be converted by God, changed from liars to men of truth. Joseph had put them to the test, and he was no doubt trusting God to work in their hearts to convert them. As we shall see later, God was working.
Thought. Few people tell the truth all the time. Most people will stretch the truth and lie when they are caught in an undesirable situation. People stretch the truth and lie  when they are caught in an undesirable situation. People stretch the truth and lie
to husband or wife
to children or parents
to fellow workers or supervisors
to friend or neighbor
Telling the truth is so important that it is one of the quickest ways a person can change his behavior. If a person really wants to change—really wants to become a new person—then being a truthful person will help change him as quickly as anything.
Note that God is a God of truth.
Note that we are to be men and women of truth. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 345). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


Jacob (Israel) faced his own personal struggle: he faced a frightening problem (vv. 6–7).

2. What complaint did Jacob raise, and how did the brothers respond? (v. 6)

Jacob asked why did they treat him so badly by telling Joseph about Benjamin 
a third step that can change a person’s life is facing personal struggles. Israel (Jacob) had to face the problem of his own personal struggle.
His major concern was this: if he sent all eleven sons to Egypt and they were all executed, he would have no sons to carry on the promised seed and family of believers promised by God. His sons were to be the promised line of believers, the promised line through whom the Savior of the world was to come. And now, they were all facing a capital charge in Egypt. If he could just keep Benjamin, even if the others were executed, Benjamin could carry on the promised seed and line for God.
This was the struggle, the pain in Jacob’s heart. He could not see any way out of the terrible difficulty confronting him and his family. His only hope was to handle it in the faith and strength of the new name that the LORD had given him, the name of Israel. Remember that Israel means two things
Thought 1. When we are struggling with some personal problem, we must face it and deal with it. Personal struggles that are not faced head-on can cause inner turmoil and health problems, both physical and mental. Facing the personal struggles that bother us can change our lives and turn us completely around.
Our need is to do what Jacob had learned to do: go before the LORD as Israel, as a person who cries out to God and continues to cry out until he prevails with God. God will hear us and strengthen us to deal with the personal struggles of our lives.

Judah offered to be surety for Benjamin: he was willing to sacrifice himself for others (vv. 8–10).
3. What assurance did Judah give Jacob? What reason did he give? (Think: What qualities is Judah beginning to demonstrate?) (v. 8-10)

Judah told Jacob that he would bear the blame if anything should happen to Benjamin 
Judah offers to be surety for Benjamin in case anything happens to Benjamin.
Judah’s proposal differs from that of Reuben. The latter was willing to put the lives of two of his sons on the line (42:37). Judah is prepared to place his own life on the line.
Judah was willing to sacrifice himself for Benjamin. He was actually willing to exchange his life for the life of another person. This shows just how much Judah was growing through this whole experience. God was working within his heart and moving him to that great moment of salvation and conversion, the great moment when he would give his heart and life to God and begin to follow Him.
Note three facts about Judah at this point.
Judah had sinned. He was present when Joseph was sold by his brothers; however, he did try to stop them (Ge. 37:26). He had also committed incest (Ge. 38:1f).
Judah now began to stand out from among the sons. From this point on there seemed to be a great change taking place in his heart and life (see Ge. 43:8–9; 44:14–34; 46:28).
Judah was to be chosen as the promised line, the line through whom the promised seed, the Savior and Messiah, was to come (see note—Ge. 38:26).

4. What decision did Jacob make, and what advice did he give? (Think: What does this show about the famine in Canaan?) (v. 11-13)
Jacob decided to let Benjamin go to Egypt
Jacob told his sons to take a gift to the man (Joseph). This gift included:
Balm
Honey
Spices
Nuts
Double the amount of silver

Jacob cast his sons upon God’s care: he entrusted their care to God Almighty (v. 14).
5. Explain 43:14 in your own words.

“May God Almighty be with you so that you are well received and so that you may return safely with Benjamin and Simeon. If anything happens, I will deal with the outcome”
and may he [the man? El Shaddai?] send back your other brother with you, and Benjamin. Jacob is more interested in his sons than in more corn, and his sympathies are more with Benjamin than with Simeon, whom he simply calls your other brother.
Trust—Prayer: a sixth step that can change a person’s life is entrusting one’s care to God Almighty. 
Israel himself (Jacob) could do nothing more. It was now time to turn to God. This Israel did. He prayed right there before his sons, speaking both to God and to them. 
Note that he called upon God Almighty (El Shaddai). This was the name that stressed God’s power, His unlimited, omnipotent power. Israel was calling upon God to use His power to control the hearts of the Egyptian governor. 
He was crying for God to make the governor’s heart soft so that he would drop the charge of spying against his sons, free Simeon, and send all of his sons back home.
Note that Israel declared his faith: he would accept God’s will. If within God’s will he was to lose his sons, he would be bereaved, so let him be bereaved.
Thought. God has the power to change our lives. 
This is the number one reason to trust God, the very reason we must give our lives to Him. 
God can change our lives for good: He can save and deliver us through all the trials and difficulties of life. 
God has the power to work all things out for good, no matter how severe and terrible the circumstances may be. 
God can take anything wrong in our lives and change it for good. All we have to do is what Israel did: turn to Him and entrust our lives into His hands. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 348). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


The brothers went to Egypt: they proved their word, that they were trustworthy (vv. 15–22).
The brothers did just as the governor had demanded: they stood before Joseph with Benjamin (v. 15). Note that the brothers stood together as a family unit for the first time in some twenty years. The important fact is this: they stood together as a family unit, not because of their own doing but by the power of God (see note—Ge. 42:1–38):
the power of God in nature. They stood there because of the famine.
the power of God in a man’s life, the life of Joseph. They stood there because of Joseph’s demand to prove their word and trustworthiness (see note—Ge. 42:6–20).

6. What did Joseph invite his brothers to do, and what did they think?

Joseph invited them to his home
They thought they were in trouble for the silver they found in their sacks
wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves. They probably know that high Egyptian officials keep dungeons in their homes (see 40:3; 42:17). Again, this is an ironic image of their treatment of Joseph.

7. What did they say to the steward? How did he respond? (Think: Explain this response.)

They told the steward about how they discovered the silver in their sacks. Note what they did.
They approached the steward as soon as they entered the door (v. 19).
They began to explain how they found the money in their sacks. They told the truth with strict honesty (v. 20). This would be important for Joseph to know, that they were totally accurate in telling the truth.
They were ready to correct the matter: they were returning the money (v. 21).
They had brought additional money to buy the present supply of food (v. 22).
They did not know who had put the silver back in their sacks before (v. 22b). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 349). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Thought. Nothing is more important than our word. If our word can be trusted, then we can be trusted. If our word cannot be trusted, then we cannot be trusted. Note this: our word is what we are, and we are what our word is. Our word matches our character and our character matches our word. One way to change our lives is to change our word: become trustworthy. Tell the truth. Be a person who can be trusted and depended upon. Be faithful to your word. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 349). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
The steward told them not to worry, for God had provided them the silver
It’s all right. The steward literally says, “Peace [šālôm] to you.”
Your God, the God of your father. This turning point in the relationship of the brothers toward Joseph, from fear (see 42:21–22, 28, 35; 43:18) to peace, is spoken by a foreigner who trusts in their God. He recognizes that Providence directs human acts (see 45:5).

The brothers accepted the true affection of Joseph (vv. 23–31).
8. Who joined them, and how did they prepare to meet Joseph?
They prepared to meet Joseph by washing their feet

9. What was Joseph’s first question, and how did they respond?

Joseph asked, “how is your aged father doing? Is he still living?”
They told Joseph that Jacob was alive and well

10. What did he say to Benjamin, and how did he react to meeting him?

He told Benjamin, “God be gracious to you”
Immediately, Joseph went to a private place to weep
a place to weep. Joseph can only retain his power of knowledge by withdrawing to weep three times (42:24; 43:30; 45:1–2, 14–15). Underneath the cloak of Egyptian appearance, his love for his family throbs.

11. Who sat at different tables? Why? (Think: What would this mean about Joseph’s position?) (v. 32)

The positions in life and caste distinctions were observed
Joseph had his own table
This is because of Joseph’s exalted position
Joseph brothers had their own table
The Egyptians had their own table
cultic taboos forbade Egyptians eating with Hebrews. They will sell and share food with Hebrews, but will not share a table with Hebrews
detestable to Egyptians. Herein lies a clue to the rationale for the Egyptian sojourn. Whereas the Canaanites are willing to integrate and absorb the sons of Israel, the Egyptians hold them in contempt. Judah’s intermarriage with the Canaanites in Genesis 38 shows the danger that syncretistic Canaanites present to the embryonic family. The Egyptian segregated culture guarantees that the embryonic nation can develop into a great nation within their borders. The Egyptian threat will take the form of tyranny

12. Special Assignment: Summarize what the Bible teaches about the superiority of races and nationalities

13. Explain the seating of Joseph’s brothers and how this affected them.

Joseph arranged for them to be seated in order of birth
This arrangement astonished Joseph brothers

14. How did Benjamin’s meal differ from that of his brothers? (Think: Consider how Joseph’s conduct would affect his brothers.)

Benjamin’s portion was five times as large as the other brothers
Joseph tests the brothers for jealousy. This preferential treatment is comparable to the preferential treatment Jacob gave Joseph. To be invited to a meal with a high official assumes a close relationship with him, but it is fraught with the potential for promotion or rejection. 
Proverbs 23:1–3 instructs the wise son not to be distracted by the official’s food; the guest’s character is either intentionally or unwittingly under surveillance by the higher official.

The chapter concludes with And they feasted and drank with him. The Hebrew reads literally, “they drank and got drunk with him.”
Thought. We must accept our present lot and position in life.The first step toward doing this is to accept where we are today: determine where we stand, what our lot and position is, and then begin to move forward. The answer to improving ourselves …
is not to despair at our lot and position
 is not to rebel against others who hold higher positions than we do
is not to react against those who are more favored than we are
 is not to scheme and plot against those who have more skill and money than we do

            <Text>Joseph Tests His Brothers
44 Then he commanded the steward of his house, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack, 2 and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph told him. 

3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys. 4 They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? 5 Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.’ ” 

6 When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words. 7 They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! 8 Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house? 9 Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord’s servants.” 10 He said, “Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent.” 11 Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack. 12 And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 13 Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city. 

14 When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground. 15 Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?” 16 And Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord’s servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.” 17 But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.” 

18 Then Judah went up to him and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself. 19 My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’ 20 And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother’s children, and his father loves him.’ 21 Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’ 22 We said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’ 23 Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.’ 

24 “When we went back to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 25 And when our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food,’ 26 we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 27 Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons. 28 One left me, and I said, “Surely he has been torn to pieces,” and I have never seen him since. 29 If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.’ 

30 “Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy’s life, 31 as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. 32 For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.’ 33 Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers. 34 For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father.”

            <Title>Gen 44 Hamilton</Title>
            <Text>5  What makes the cup in Benjamin’s sack so valuable is that it is Joseph’s own cup, and the one in which he practices divination (naḥēš yenaḥēš). The force here of the infinitive absolute (naḥēš) before the verb is uncertain; usually it lends extra emphasis to the verb.
Drinking goblets can be replaced more easily than divination goblets. The form of divination referred to here is oleomancy (pouring oil into water) or hydromancy (pouring water into oil), or the more general term lecanomancy (observing the actions of liquids in some kind of a container). When water and oil are mixed, configurations form which are then studied and interpreted by the diviner. Do the movements portend peace/war, success/failure, progeny/no progeny, recovered health/prolonged sickness, etc.? So important was divination in Mesopotamia that divinatory texts developed into the largest single category of Akkadian literature in terms of sheer number of texts.
Eating with Hebrews was anathema for the Egyptians. Attempting to ascertain the will of deity by studying the movements of oil and water was not. The first of these was an “abomination” for the Egyptians (43:32b). The second of these was an abomination for the Hebrews (Lev. 19:26; Num. 23:23; Deut. 18:10). Only later did the Hebrews “become Egyptian” in their attitude to eating with others. Recall the Samaritan woman’s surprise that Jesus would even drink water with her (John 4:9). But neither the Egyptians nor anybody in antiquity ever “became Hebrew” in their repudiation of divination techniques. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 559). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

8  The third way in which the brothers deny complicity in the theft is by appealing to their own previous conduct. Would those who earlier returned the money found in their bags be so foolish to steal something valuable and sacred from the steward’s master? According to the Midrash (Gen. Rabbah 92:7) Rabbi Ishmael (2nd century a.d.) remarked: “this is one of the ten instancs of qal wa-ḥomer [i.e., the argument from the minor to the major] in the Torah [i.e., the Bible].” The other nine are Exod. 6:12; Num. 12:14; Deut. 31:27; 1 Sam. 23:3; Jer. 12:5 (twice); Ezek. 15:5; Prov. 11:31; Esth. 9:12. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 562). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

9 Note that the brothers themselves decide on the harshest sentence: he shall die. They do not say “he deserves to die”; they do not appeal to divine judgment. The thief is to be executed for committing a capital offense. That Jacob orders the death of the person who stole Laban’s teraphim, or that Joseph’s brothers suggest the death penalty for the one guilty of stealing Joseph’s goblet, cannot be used as proof for the existence of a special category of theft—stealing sancta. Indeed, v. 5 would suggest (the words that Joseph instructs his steward with which to charge his recently departed brothers) that the men would not even know it was Joseph’s own cup or that it was used for sacred purposes. Jacob’s sentence merely illustrates the total power of the paterfamilias. Joseph’s brothers are so certain of their innocence that they can afford this extravagant offer. It is a demonstration of their confidence in and conviction about their innocence. At one point Jacob’s proposed sentence is different from that of Joseph’s brothers. Jacob admitted liability of the actual theft. The brothers were prepared to admit communal liability. But one can be generous with proposals when one is convinced that little is at stake. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 563). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

10  The steward responds. He begins by agreeing legally with the brothers. Their self-sentence is most appropriate in these circumstances. But then he proceeds to modify their proposal in two ways. First, the thief himself should not be killed, but enslaved. Second, the rest of the brothers should not be enslaved, but freed (neqîyim). The basic meaning of nāqá (see 24:8, 41) is “be clean, pure.” Here it takes on the derived sense of “free from servitude.” It is ironic that the accused suggest a severer penalty and the accuser suggests a lighter penalty.

12 The steward searches Benjamin’s sack last to give the appearance that he suspects Benjamin the least.
This is the second time that the brothers have been arranged by age. The first was at Joseph’s table in Egypt (43:33). The way in which the eldest and the youngest are designated in each incident is different. In 43:33 Reuben in habbeḵōr, but in 44:12 he is haggāḏôl. In 43:33 Benjamin is haṣṣāʿîr, but in 44:12 he is haqqāṭōn. The suspense of the situation is brought out in the Hebrew text by its emphasis on the goblet rather than on the steward. Instead of “and he found the goblet in Benjamin’s bag,” the text says, and the goblet was found in Benjamin’s bag. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 564). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

13 To their credit they do not at this moment abandon Benjamin, their guilty thieving brother, and head for Canaan as quickly as possible with their new supplies. Instead, they choose to return to Egypt. The brothers’ solidarity with their vulnerable, young, guilty brother will not be overlooked by Joseph. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 564). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.


15 Joseph’s rhetorical question may be interpreted in one of two ways. He may have implied, “Why did you steal my cup? Don’t you know I need it for divining?” Or he may have implied, “Did you think you could get away with stealing my cup? You know I am a master of divination and would have found you out, one way or the other.” I prefer the second interpretation, for it underscores the utter helplessness of the brothers. They are foreigners in Egypt. They are thieves, or at least one of them is. They are at the mercy of a man who can track them anywhere with his divinatory power. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 565). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

16 Joseph’s rhetorical question may be interpreted in one of two ways. He may have implied, “Why did you steal my cup?

The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 565). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

17 Joseph is trusting that the brothers will not accept his counterproposal without protest. They were willing to leave Simeon behind and return to Canaan. Will they now leave Benjamin behind and return to Canaan? Of course, in the first instance Joseph had attached a proviso—“If you want Simeon released and if you want more corn, you must go and bring back your youngest brother.” Here Joseph is offering a permanent separation. He does not say: “If you want to see your youngest brother again, go and bring back your father.” On the surface, Joseph wants the case closed. Happily, in v. 18 Judah steps forward and offers evidence why Joseph’s ruling is unacceptable to them. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 566). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

18-32 Thus vv. 18–32 comprise the renarration of nine previous speeches. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 569). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Judah again places special emphasis on their father’s inability to survive without Benjamin, but carefully deleting Jacob’s initial refusal to release Benjamin (42:38). Benjamin’s failure to return to Canaan will bring about their father’s death. Judah suggests again in the third subsection (vv. 30–31) what a fatal blow Benjamin’s detention in Eygpt would be to their father. Only at the end of this first section (v. 32) does he mention his own involvement in Benjamin’s well-being. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 570). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

33-34
A spiritual metamorphosis for the better has certainly taken place in Judah. His speech to Joseph in ch. 44 represents a profound advancement over his speech about Joseph in 37:26ff. He who once callously engineered the selling of Joseph to strangers out of envy and anger is now willing to become Joseph’s slave so that the rest of his brothers, and especially Benjamin, may be freed and allowed to return to Canaan to rejoin their father.
Among modern commentators only G. W. Coats focuses on factors other than a genuine change in Judah’s attitude and deportment. He suggests that Judah’s offer does not arise from any character change within, but from the exigencies of circumstances over which he has no control. He made an oath to his father. His options are twofold: Take his chances staying in Egypt (note that Judah uses a softer word, stay [yēšeḇ, lit., “dwell”], rather than a stronger word, like “be bound” or “enslaved”), or live under the guilt of a broken surety oath. But is not Judah’s taking of the oath in the first place dictated by the knowledge that vicarious suffering is a real possibility in the near future? Whence springs this willingness to become Benjamin’s substitute, if not from a dynamic, spiritual change within Judah? Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 570).

in the mouth of his sack. When the steward searches the brothers’ sacks (44:12), they will all look guilty of theft. Nevertheless, the steward will clear all of them of any charges except Benjamin. If motivated by selfish interests, not the good of the family, the brothers are being given every reason to free themselves from slavery and abandon Benjamin. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J.

youngest one’s sack. The original crime pertained to the brothers’ hatred of Joseph, Rachel’s son and Jacob’s favorite, and the brothers selling him into slavery. Joseph brilliantly recreates the same grouping. Will they remain loyal to Joseph’s full brother even when he looks guilty of theft? Or will they abandon him in Egypt as they had innocent Joseph?

5. divination. The techniques of hydromancy (pouring water into oil), oelomancy (oil into water), and oenomancy (wine into another liquid) were commonplace in the ancient Near East. Through the surface patterns formed by pouring one type of liquid upon another, the practitioner professed to determine the mind of the gods with reference to the future, to the source of trouble, or to the truth of guilt or innocence. Referring to the wine goblet as a divining cup contributes to the ruse. Joseph receives revelation from God alone (37:5–9; 41:16; see Theological Reflections below). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 560). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

10 the rest of you will be free. They will be free from servitude. When Benjamin is found to have the cup, they will be confronted with a choice that has significant similarities to their choice with Joseph. Benjamin, like Joseph, is innocent, but they are free to leave him in slavery in Egypt.

14. Judah. He is clearly the leader. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 561). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

16. Judah replied. In this first speech Judah makes three points: he protests the brother’s innocence of the theft, confesses their dilemma as due to God’s judgment for previous guilt, and finally offers all of the brothers as slaves. In that way he undoes the rash oath to kill the guilty and avoids having to face their father.
How can we prove our innocence? The circumstantial evidence against them is so overwhelming, it is pointless to defend themselves.
God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. He cannot be referring to the goblet, for he has just asserted their innocence. He may be referring to guilt in general, but more probably to their crime against Joseph. If so, they confess their crime against Joseph twice in his presence (42:21). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 561). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

18 He first rehearses the history of their two journeys to Egypt, focusing on their father’s great reluctance to accede to Joseph’s demand to send the son lest he suffer the pain of losing another son (44:18–29). He emphasizes that the loss of this son will kill the father (44:30–31). He culminates his appeal by asking Joseph to allow him to fulfill his pledge and become the slave in the boy’s stead to spare his father misery (44:32–34). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 561). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

33. in place of the boy. This first instance of human substitution in Scripture reveals a different Judah than the one who sold his brother into slavery (37:26–27). Sternberg notes, “Simply, Judah so feels for his father that he begs to sacrifice himself for a brother more loved than himself.” Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 562). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

34. see the misery. A formerly callused Judah (see 37:34–35) is now compassionate. Sternberg explains, “That Judah should adduce the father’s favoritism as the ground for self-sacrifice is such an irresistible proof of filial devotion that it breaks down Joseph’s last defenses.” Judah’s love excels (see 43:3). He is worthy of kingship. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 562). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

            <Text>(44:6–13) Family—Home: Are we willing to stand by the family? This is the second test of loyalty: being willing to stand by the family no matter what confronts them.
a. There was a strong charge made against the brothers (v. 6). The steward quickly caught the brothers and leveled the charge of stealing against them.
b. But they made a clear declaration of innocence (v. 7).
⇒	They strongly declared their honesty: since they had returned the money they had found in their sacks on their first trip, why would they steal silver or gold now (vv. 7b–8)?
⇒	Note that they declared their willingness to stand together as a family unit (v. 9). They were so confident of their innocence, they made a rash suggestion: if the silver cup was found stolen by any one of them, let him be executed, and the other brothers would become slaves of Joseph. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 355). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

But note what they did: they proved their loyalty to the family. They passed the first stage of the test given by Joseph, passed it with flying colors. They were not going to forsake Benjamin. They were not going to allow even one member to be ripped apart from the family. The steward had said the innocent brothers were free: they could turn and go home. But this they were not going to do. They were going to stand together as a family. Together, they loaded their donkeys and returned to the city where the governor, Joseph, was waiting to charge them with the crime of stealing and most likely to enslave them (v. 13). When they walked into Joseph’s house, he would learn what he had hoped: the brothers had undergone a tremendous change within their hearts. They were learning the great importance of the chosen family: they were now willing to stand together as the chosen family of believers. They were now willing to stand together to face whatever might come, no matter how terrible the situation was. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 355). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

(44:14–17) Family—Forgiveness: Are we willing to seek forgiveness with the family? This is the third test of loyalty: being willing to seek forgiveness with the family no matter how serious the failing. Some twenty years earlier, the brothers had failed in the most terrible way possible for a person to fail: they had threatened to kill Joseph but ended up selling him into slavery. And they had never confessed their sin to anyone so far as is known: not to their father nor to God and, of course, never to Joseph. They needed to confess it to all three, especially to God. Now they were going to get the opportunity to confess to God and to Joseph. Would they pass this test? And if so, would they do it begrudgingly or with the same flying colors they had just demonstrated with Benjamin? Were the sons going to confess and repent in order to be converted, become true followers of God? Note what happened when they confronted Joseph.
a. There was a strong united act: they all demonstrated humility together (vv. 14–15). As soon as they entered the house of Joseph, they fell to the floor bowing before him. Joseph was no doubt overjoyed to see them all together standing by the side of their brother Benjamin. He now knew they were committed to stand together as a family, every one of them. Now, with God’s help, he needed to lead them to confession and repentance of their sin and to a commitment to stand together in following God Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 356). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

1)	Note their confession: God had uncovered and found out their sin—not just Benjamin’s sin, but their sin, the sin for which they were all guilty. Judah was confessing that they were all guilty of sin, and God was now punishing them for it. God was punishing Benjamin, yes, but also punishing them for the sin they had committed in the past, the terrible sin of having sold their brother into slavery. Judah did not mention this sin publicly. That had already been done earlier in the presence of Joseph and his interpreter (Ge. 42:21–24). But the meaning of Judah’s confession is clear: God had uncovered the sins of all the brothers, and they were now ready and willing to bear God’s punishment. They were now ready to become the slaves of Joseph, all of them together, for they were all guilty before God (v. 16).
⇒	Note the declaration of belief in God: that He holds us accountable.
⇒	Note the confession: they were all guilty of sin.
⇒	Note the repentance: they were now ready and willing to follow God’s will even if it meant being punished for their sins. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 356). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

c. The test continued: Joseph just felt compelled to prove that the brothers were totally loyal to each other and to the family of God (v. 17). He declared that he could not enslave the innocent brothers, only the brother who had stolen the cup. Then he charged all the brothers to leave and go back home, all except Benjamin, the suspected thief. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 356).

Deeper Study # 1
(44:15) Divination—Fortune-Telling—Sorcery: divination is a heathen custom that has been practiced throughout the ages in all civilizations. The particular practice mentioned here used either oil by itself or else water with gold or silver in the bottom of a bowl or cup. The rays of light reflecting from the oil or water would form certain designs that were supposed to reveal the future.
Did Joseph actually practice this heathen custom, practice it of his own free will? Or was he, as the governor of Egypt, expected to practice the custom? Did he practice it in order to accommodate the people’s expectation? Or was Joseph just associating himself with the sacred cup in order to drive more fear into his brothers? Identifying the cup as a cup of divination would place far more value upon it. This would make the penalty for stealing it far worse. The brothers would sense far more guilt for having stolen it and expect a far stiffer sentence.
It is very unlikely that Joseph practiced divination, for God issues strict warnings against the practice. Joseph most likely was just referring to the cup as a cup of divination in order to strike more fear in the brothers. The more important the cup the more fear, and the more they feared, the more likely they were to turn away from Benjamin to let him face the sentence all alone. This test was going to show exactly how strongly they were committed to each other and to the family. If they were totally committed to the family, they would stand by the side of Benjamin, bearing the penalty with him. If they had any lack of loyalty whatsoever—any weakness of attachment to the family—they would leave Benjamin to face the penalty alone. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).

18-23
Practically every commentary on Genesis stresses the strength of Judah’s plea. In the speech, Judah stood forth as a magnificent picture of Christ, of His great intercession and voluntary sacrifice for mankind. The tenderness and warmth of his words and the love expressed for his father are seldom seen among men. And just imagine: this came from the heart of a man who had been so mean and sinful, so immoral and evil, that he had broken the heart of his father years before. Judah is a dynamic example of the glorious mercy of God. If Judah and his brothers could be saved, then any person can be saved.
b. Judah reminded Joseph of the demand he had made of them. Note the facts Judah stressed (vv. 18–23).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of his inquiry about their family, asking if they had a brother or father (v. 19).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of their father: that their father was old and had two other sons. One son was dead and the other son was the child of their father’s old age. And their father loved him dearly (v. 20).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of his demand to bring Benjamin to Egypt to prove that they were telling the truth (v. 21).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of their caution and reservation: taking Benjamin from their father might kill him (v. 22).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of his insistence: they had to bring Benjamin, or they would never be allowed to see the governor’s face again; they would never be allowed to get any more food (v. 23). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 358). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

c. Judah related how the brothers had told their father about the demand of the governor (vv. 24–29). Note that Joseph had no way to know about these facts. He was hearing for the very first time what had happened when his brothers had returned home to their father.
⇒	He related how the need for more food arose (v. 25).
⇒	He related how the sons reminded their father of the demand of the governor: the youngest brother had to go with them (v. 26).
⇒	He related their father’s response: his wife had borne him two sons and one had been torn to pieces (vv. 27–28).
⇒	He related how their father feared losing the second son: losing him would kill their father (v. 29).
d. Judah related his great concern (vv. 30–31). Note that his concern was not Benjamin’s guilt or innocence nor the freedom or enslavement of the brothers. Judah’s concern was his father. He did not want the heart of his father to be broken. Judah loved his father so much that he did not even want him to suffer pain. Note what he related to the governor:
⇒	Their father’s life was closely bound up with Benjamin (v. 30).
⇒	Their father would die if the boy were not with them when they returned home (v. 31a).
⇒	The sons—the servants of Joseph—would therefore be guilty of killing their father because they did not bring the boy home (v. 31b).
e. What now happened was very significant: Judah pleaded his case before Joseph, proving his loyalty and love to the family beyond any question.
1)	Judah shared that he had personally become surety for Benjamin (v. 32). If he failed to take the boy to his father, then he would bear the blame for the rest of his life.
2)	Judah then did an amazing thing. He offered to sacrifice himself for Benjamin (vv. 32–33). He asked Joseph to let him become the slave and to free Benjamin, letting him go home to his father (v. 32). He offered …
•	to become the substitute for Benjamin
•	to accept the punishment due Benjamin
•	to bear the guilt for Benjamin
•	to suffer in behalf of Benjamin
•	to give his life for the life of Benjamin
•	to switch places with Benjamin
Note why Judah did this: because of his father. How could he possibly go back to his father if Benjamin were not with him? His father would suffer undue misery, and he, Judah, would have to see his father suffer the misery for the rest of his life (v. 23). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 358–359). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 2. Note how Judah became a magnificent picture of Christ in the above scene. Henry Morris states it well:
In this willingness to give his own life in place of his brother’s, for the sake of his father, Judah becomes a beautiful type of Christ, more fully and realistically than even Joseph himself, who is often taken by Bible expositors as a type of Christ. “Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren” (1 John 3:16).
In fact, although Scripture does not say this in so many words, the problem as to why Judah, rather than Joseph, was selected to be the ancestor of the Messiah probably has its solution right here. Judah, in his willingness to sacrifice himself, the innocent for the guilty, had become the most Christlike of all his brothers.
This was it, the end of Judah’s speech. Joseph now knew that God had done a marvelous work in their lives. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 359). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

            <Text>6-13 So they load up their donkeys and return in trepidation to the city. The significance of that moment is not to be overlooked. According to the terms set by the steward, only the guilty party would be punished. The other brothers were free. Conceivably, they could have abandoned their brother to his fate, ridding themselves again of their father’s favourite son. But they choose solidarity with Benjamin ahead of their own self-interest. Here is a model for the church family. It is the members who put solidarity (even with the party apparently in the wrong) before self-interest, who have discerned the way of God. Wilcox, P. (2007). Living the Dream: Joseph for Today: A Dramatic Exposition of Genesis 37–50 (pp. 75–76). Milton Keynes, UK; Colorado Springs, CO; Secunderabad, AP: Paternoster.

14-34 Judah says to Joseph, ‘God has found out our guilt.’ The ironies that run through the narrative are at their greatest here. The reader is in no doubt that Judah’s words refer not to the theft of the cup, but to the sin the brothers had committed over twenty years previously against their brother—who now stands before them as their judge. He knows they are innocent of this crime, and he knows they are guilty of the other crime. They know (or they think they know) that he is convinced of their guilt in relation to this crime and that he is ignorant of the earlier one. Somehow the sin the brothers are not able to confess prevents them from defending themselves fully over the sin they have not committed. Wilcox, P. (2007). Living the Dream: Joseph for Today: A Dramatic Exposition of Genesis 37–50 (p. 78). Milton Keynes, UK; Colorado Springs, CO; Secunderabad, AP: Paternoster.

However, the acknowledgement of God’s judgment and the real selflessness of Judah’s offer (even in the face of his father’s continued favouritism, compare verse 20 and the reference to Rachel as if she was Jacob’s only wife in verse 27) demonstrate how much the brothers have changed in that time.
Judah’s act of self-sacrifice is all the more impressive given the context of adversity. His family face famine and his father is frail. The temptation must have been strong to think, ‘What I have, I hold.’ The same dynamics beset the church. The tendency to behave in partisan ways is great when the future is bleak, and in such circumstances, self-sacrificial behaviour is correspondingly heroic. Wilcox, P. (2007).

            <Text>44 Then he commanded the steward of his house, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man’s money in the mouth of his sack, 2 and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain.” And he did as Joseph told him. 

What instructions did Joseph give his servant in vv 1,2?
To fill their sacks with food with their money
To put his silver cup in Benjamin’s sack with his money for the grain

Why does Joseph give the instruction for the steward to plant Joseph’s
silver cup in Benjamin’s sack?

Joseph is testing the genuineness of his once hateful brothers’ conversion

The original crime pertained to the brothers’ hatred of Joseph, Rachel’s son and Jacob’s favorite, and the brothers selling him into slavery. 
Will they remain loyal to Joseph’s full brother even when he looks guilty of theft? Or will they abandon him in Egypt as they had innocent Joseph? Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 559). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

“3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their donkeys. 4 They had gone only a short distance from the city. Now Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow after the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? 5 Is it not from this that my lord drinks, and by this that he practices divination? You have done evil in doing this.’ ” 

What accusation did the steward make against the men? (Think: Define “divining.” Did Joseph actually divine? What was the source of his power?)

He accused them of stealing Joseph’s cup
the city. This is in the region of Goshen but otherwise unidentified. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 560). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

The form of divination referred to here is 
oleomancy (pouring oil into water) or 
hydromancy (pouring water into oil), or the more general term 
lecanomancy (observing the actions of liquids in some kind of a container). 
When water and oil are mixed, configurations form which are then studied and interpreted by the diviner. 
Do the movements portend peace/war, success/failure, progeny/no progeny, recovered health/prolonged sickness, etc.? 
So important was divination in Mesopotamia that divinatory texts developed into the largest single category of Akkadian literature in terms of sheer number of texts. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 559). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
Referring to the wine goblet as a divining cup contributes to the ruse. Joseph receives revelation from God alone (37:5–9; 41:16; see Theological Reflections below). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 560). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

“6 When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words. 7 They said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! 8 Behold, the money that we found in the mouths of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your lord’s house? 9 Whichever of your servants is found with it shall die, and we also will be my lord’s servants.” 10 He said, “Let it be as you say: he who is found with it shall be my servant, and the rest of you shall be innocent.” 11 Then each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each man opened his sack. 12 And he searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 13 Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.”

What response did the brothers give to the accusation?

They declared their innocence. 
Would those who earlier returned the money found in their bags be so foolish to steal something valuable and sacred from the steward’s master? 
According to the Midrash (Gen. Rabbah 92:7) Rabbi Ishmael (2nd century a.d.) remarked: “this is one of the ten instancs of qal wa-ḥomer [i.e., the argument from the minor to the major] in the Torah [i.e., the Bible].” 
The other nine are Exod. 6:12; Num. 12:14; Deut. 31:27; 1 Sam. 23:3; Jer. 12:5 (twice); Ezek. 15:5; Prov. 11:31; Esth. 9:12. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 562). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
They told the steward that whoever stole the would be worthy of death and the rest would server the governor as slaves
Joseph’s brothers are so certain of their innocence that they can afford this extravagant offer. It is a demonstration of their confidence in and conviction about their innocence. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 563). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

How does the steward respond to the brothers’ proposed sentence?

He begins by agreeing legally with the brothers. Their self-sentence is most appropriate in these circumstances. But then he proceeds to modify their proposal in two ways. 
First, the thief himself should not be killed, but enslaved. 
Second, the rest of the brothers should not be enslaved, but freed (neqîyim). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 563). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
quickly lowered. This shows their innocence. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 560). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

Who was considered guilty, and what did the brothers do?

Benjamin was declared guilty. The brothers tore their clothes and returned to the city
V. 13. they tore their clothes. Their actions confirm their character change. They now show affection for their father and brother (contra 37:34).
V. 13 all … returned. They pass the test; they do not abandon their brother Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 560). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.
They proved their loyalty to the family. 
They were not going to forsake Benjamin. 
They were not going to allow even one member to be ripped apart from the family.
They were going to stand together as a family.
When they walked into Joseph’s house, he would learn what he had hoped: the brothers had undergone a tremendous change within their hearts. 
They were now willing to stand together to face whatever might come, no matter how terrible the situation was. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 355). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Here is a model for the church family - are we going to seek solidarity over self-interest?

“14 When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, he was still there. They fell before him to the ground. 15 Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?” 16 And Judah said, “What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how can we clear ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your servants; behold, we are my lord’s servants, both we and he also in whose hand the cup has been found.” 17 But he said, “Far be it from me that I should do so! Only the man in whose hand the cup was found shall be my servant. But as for you, go up in peace to your father.” 

Joseph said to them, “What deed is this that you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?”
He may have implied, “Why did you steal my cup? Don’t you know I need it for divining?” 
Or he may have implied, “Did you think you could get away with stealing my cup? You know I am a master of divination and would have found you out, one way or the other.” 
I prefer the second interpretation, for it underscores the utter helplessness of the brothers. They are foreigners in Egypt. They are thieves, or at least one of them is. They are at the mercy of a man who can track them anywhere with his divinatory power. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 565). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

 How does Judah respond to Joseph? What confession did Judah make to Joseph?

In this first speech Judah makes three points: 
he protests the brother’s innocence of the theft, 
How can we prove our innocence? The circumstantial evidence against them is so overwhelming, it is pointless to defend themselves.
confesses their dilemma as due to God’s judgment for previous guilt, 
God has uncovered your servants’ guilt. Judah was confessing that they were all guilty of sin, and God was now punishing them for it. 
God was  punishing them for the sin they had committed in the past, the terrible sin of having sold their brother into slavery. Judah did not mention this sin publicly.If so, they confess their crime against Joseph twice in his presence (42:21).

⇒Note the declaration of belief in God: that He holds us accountable.
Note the confession: they were all guilty of sin.
Note the repentance: they were now ready and willing to follow God’s will even if it meant being punished for their sins. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 356). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

and finally offers all of the brothers as slaves. In that way he undoes the rash oath to kill the guilty and avoids having to face their father.  Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 561). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.



 What punishment did Joseph insist upon?

Joseph just felt compelled to prove that the brothers were totally loyal to each other and to the family of God (v. 17). He declared that he could not enslave the innocent brothers, only the brother who had stolen the cup. Then he charged all the brothers to leave and go back home, all except Benjamin, the suspected thief. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 356). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


“18 Then Judah went up to him and said, “Oh, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself. 19 My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’ 20 And we said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an old man, and a young brother, the child of his old age. His brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother’s children, and his father loves him.’ 21 Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’ 22 We said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’ 23 Then you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you shall not see my face again.’ 

24 “When we went back to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 25 And when our father said, ‘Go again, buy us a little food,’ 26 we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother goes with us, then we will go down. For we cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 27 Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons. 28 One left me, and I said, “Surely he has been torn to pieces,” and I have never seen him since. 29 If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him, you will bring down my gray hairs in evil to Sheol.’”

Summarize the story as Judah told it (vv 18-29).

Judah reminded Joseph of the demand he had made of them. Note the facts Judah stressed (vv. 18–23).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of his inquiry about their family, asking if they had a brother or father (v. 19).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of their father: that their father was old and had two other sons. One son was dead and the other son was the child of their father’s old age. And their father loved him dearly (v. 20).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of his demand to bring Benjamin to Egypt to prove that they were telling the truth (v. 21).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of their caution and reservation: taking Benjamin from their father might kill him (v. 22).
⇒	He reminded Joseph of his insistence: they had to bring Benjamin, or they would never be allowed to see the governor’s face again; they would never be allowed to get any more food (v. 23). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 358). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Judah related how the brothers had told their father about the demand of the governor (vv. 24–29). Note that Joseph had no way to know about these facts. He was hearing for the very first time what had happened when his brothers had returned home to their father.
⇒	He related how the need for more food arose (v. 25).
⇒	He related how the sons reminded their father of the demand of the governor: the youngest brother had to go with them (v. 26).
⇒	He related their father’s response: his wife had borne him two sons and one had been torn to pieces (vv. 27–28).
⇒	He related how their father feared losing the second son: losing him would kill their father (v. 29).

30 “Now therefore, as soon as I come to your servant my father, and the boy is not with us, then, as his life is bound up in the boy’s life, 31 as soon as he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die, and your servants will bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to Sheol. 32 For your servant became a pledge of safety for the boy to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then I shall bear the blame before my father all my life.’ 33 Now therefore, please let your servant remain instead of the boy as a servant to my lord, and let the boy go back with his brothers. 34 For how can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the evil that would find my father.” 
 The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ge 44:1–34). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.

What problem did Judah fear (vv 30,31)?
That if Benjamin did not return to Canaan it would crush Jacob

Judah’s concern was his father. He did not want the heart of his father to be broken. Judah loved his father so much that he did not even want him to suffer pain. Note what he related to the governor:
⇒	Their father’s life was closely bound up with Benjamin (v. 30).
⇒	Their father would die if the boy were not with them when they returned home (v. 31a).
⇒	The sons—the servants of Joseph—would therefore be guilty of killing their father because they did not bring the boy home (v. 31b).

Why did Judah feel especially responsible for Benjamin?
He had made a pledge of safety to Jacob for Benjamin. He would bear all the blame if Benjamin should not return or suffer harm

What alternative did Judah propose, and what reason did he give (vv 33,34)? (Think: Note the similarities between Jesus’ sacrifice and what Judah proposed.)

Judah begged Joseph to take him as a slave instead of Benjamin

Judah then did an amazing thing. He offered to sacrifice himself for Benjamin (vv. 32–33). He asked Joseph to let him become the slave and to free Benjamin, letting him go home to his father (v. 32). He offered …
•	to become the substitute for Benjamin
•	to accept the punishment due Benjamin
•	to bear the guilt for Benjamin
•	to suffer in behalf of Benjamin
•	to give his life for the life of Benjamin
•	to switch places with Benjamin

Thought 2. Note how Judah became a magnificent picture of Christ in the above scene. Henry Morris states it well:
In this willingness to give his own life in place of his brother’s, for the sake of his father, Judah becomes a beautiful type of Christ, more fully and realistically than even Joseph himself, who is often taken by Bible expositors as a type of Christ. 

16 By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (1 Jn 3:16). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.).

In fact, although Scripture does not say this in so many words, the problem as to why Judah, rather than Joseph, was selected to be the ancestor of the Messiah probably has its solution right here. Judah, in his willingness to sacrifice himself, the innocent for the guilty, had become the most Christlike of all his brothers.
This was it, the end of Judah’s speech. Joseph now knew that God had done a marvelous work in their lives. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 359). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


Special Assignment: Summarize how Judah’s statement showed the repentance of the brothers

It demonstrated that Judah and the brothers held no resentment against a son of Rachel
It demonstrated honesty and integrity
It demonstrated a willingness to self-sacrifice
It demonstrated unity

A spiritual metamorphosis for the better has certainly taken place in Judah. 
His speech to Joseph in ch. 44 represents a profound advancement over his speech about Joseph in 37:26ff. 
He who once callously engineered the selling of Joseph to strangers out of envy and anger is now willing to become Joseph’s slave so that the rest of his brothers, and especially Benjamin, may be freed and allowed to return to Canaan to rejoin their father.

            <Text>5-6 It is conceivable that the brothers will rise in rank in Egypt as their brother Joseph did. Their feet have hardly touched Egyptian soil, and already they are tantalized with the possibility of being placed in charge of the royal cattle. Pharaoh is interested not in ʾanšê miqneh (“cattle-breeders,” 46:32) but in ʾanšê-ḥayil (capable men, 47:6). This terminology indicates that the best Egyptian cattle were pastured in the area of Goshen. An Egyptian Pharaoh requesting the services of Hebrew herdsmen to tend his animals may be compared with a Hebrew Solomon requesting the services of Phoenician craftsmen to help him build a temple. Perhaps shepherding is a vocation that the upper-class Egyptian felt beneath his dignity. In this way shepherding was an “abomination” to them (46:34).
Pharaoh is magnanimous. His offer (vv. 5–6) goes beyond the request of Joseph’s brothers in v. 4. They had asked only for permission to sojourn in the land, and to dwell in Goshen. Pharaoh’s words The land of Egypt lies open to you. In the choice parts of the land settle your father are, in the words of the NT, “immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine” (Eph. 3:20, NIV). His words also evidence his benignity toward Joseph. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 608). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

7 I prefer the translation “bless” in Gen. 47:7, 10 [46:7, 10], or at least “greet with a blessing.” This is something the sons would hesitate to do (and hence its absence in v. 2), but it falls within the jurisdiction of the paterfamilias. Here is one of the relatively rare places in the OT where we find the pattern A (the inferior) blessing B (the superior). Jacob is inferior to Pharaoh as regards position, but may be superior to Pharaoh in the matter of age, and at least is well beyond the Egyptian ideal of the 110-year life. Perhaps Jacob prayed that the pharaoh may be blessed with a long life. The OT has several instances of a subject entering the presence of royalty and exclaiming “O king, live forever!” (2 Sam. 16:16; 1 K. 1:31; Dan. 2:4; 5:10; 6:7 [Eng. 6]). Such a blessing might also explain why in the next verse Pharaoh inquires about how long Jacob has lived.
Pharaoh has enriched Jacob’s family. He has promoted son Joseph to a prominent position in Egypt. On several occasions he has sent much-needed grain back to Canaan with Jacob’s other sons. He has invited Jacob and his family to Egypt with freedom to settle anywhere. Jacob is profoundly grateful for the assistance Pharaoh has provided. The appropriate response is to bless Pharaoh. “He has enriched us. May God enrich him.” Vv. 13–26, which detail Joseph’s agrarian reforms, serve as a stunning illustration of the consequence of Jacob’s blessing on Pharaoh. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 610–611). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

9 Jacob’s concern is not that he will apparently fail to live longer than either his father or grandfather. What does concern him is that his life thus far has been difficult. Just as the sons answered Pharaoh’s question, then supplied unsolicited information, so Jacob answers Pharaoh’s question, then supplies an autobiographical summary of his life. When we first encountered Jacob, he was struggling inside his mother’s womb with his twin brother. As we come to the end of Jacob’s life, he is struggling for his life in a famine-devastated Canaan. In between these first and last moments of struggle have been many trying experiences for Jacob. His life has had more sorrow than joy. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 612). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

11–12  Following Pharaoh’s orders, Joseph settles his family in Goshen, identified here as the region of Rameses. This phrase appears to be an editorial comment, for this terminology was not used until the thirteenth-century pharaohs of the 19th Dynasty. The region of Rameses (cf. Exod. 1:11; 12:37; Num. 33:3, 5) may be identified with Qantir or Tanis in the northeastern delta of the Nile. It became the residence city of the kings of the 19th Dynasty and was built by and named after Ramses II (1304–1227 b.c.). The only way to defend the presence of this place name as early as the setting of the Joseph story, that is, as something other than an editorial insertion or an anachronism, is to suggest that the city bore this name prior to the Ramesside Dynasty, a name that simply meant “Re has created it.”
Joseph exceeds the brothers’ original request. They would be content to sojourn (gûr) in Goshen. Instead, Joseph gives them property (ʾaḥuzzá). All of this confirms God’s promise to Jacob that he would make of Jacob a great nation in Egypt (46:3). This Hebrew word has already appeared in Genesis: when God so spoke to Abraham (17:8), when Abraham requested property in which to bury Sarah (23:4, 9, 20), and in reference to Edomite territory (36:43). It will be used again in 48:4 (Jacob quoting God Almighty to Joseph); in 49:30, in a reference back to ch. 23; in 50:13, also a reference back to ch. 23. Unlike naḥalá, which refers to inalienable property transmitted by inheritance, ʾaḥuzzá refers to inalienable property received from a sovereign, or at least from one who has the power to release or retain land. That is why this noun is often used with the verb “give” (Gen. 47:11; Lev. 14:34; Num. 27:4; 32:5; Deut. 32:49; etc.).
How different is Jacob’s descent to Egypt from his grandfather’s (ch. 12)! Both seek out the safety of Egypt because of famine. To save himself Abraham engages in deceit. To save his family Jacob engages in blessing. The Pharaoh at Abraham’s visit was only too happy to see Abraham return to his own country. The Pharaoh at Jacob’s visit insists that Jacob stay and settle on some choice land. Abraham retreats from Egypt. For Jacob Egypt is his new home. Abraham leaves Egypt alive (and happy to be so!). Jacob will leave Egypt dead. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 612–613). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

13-26
To that end Joseph takes from the people their money (v. 14), their livestock (vv. 15–17), and eventually their farmlands and the people’s own freedom (vv. 18–21). In exchange for these, Joseph gives the people much-needed grain. The first measure (and possibly the second), the giving of money (and cattle), extends even to the land of Canaan (vv. 13–15). The result of this reform is that former landowners now become tenants of Pharaoh, farming the land for him and paying him one-fifth of the produce as tax (vv. 20–26). Temple lands were excepted from this feudalistic system (vv. 22, 26d). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 618). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Joseph is not a callous, unethical taskmaster. True, the people forfeit ownership of their land to Pharaoh, but Joseph allows them, when this measure can be put into practice, to keep 80 percent of the harvest for themselves. Only 20 percent remains Pharaoh’s. (Cf. the 10 percent that is Yahweh’s in OT religion.) The people are evidently grateful for this arrangement, for they say to Joseph, You have rescued our lives (v. 25). Joseph is a nondiscriminating savior. His concern for Egyptians is no less than his concern for his own family. And apparently Joseph’s reforms were acceptable to later Egyptians as well, or at least to later Pharaohs. Joseph’s decree was still a law in Egypt in the writer’s day (still in force today, v. 26). Joseph’s reforms outlived Joseph. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 618–619). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

It is difficult to settle on a particular period in Egyptian history when the land-reform system, outlined in Gen. 47:13–26, prevailed in Egypt. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 619). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

The unit underscores that the Egyptians are saved and Pharaoh prospers because of the measures taken by Joseph. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 620). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

27 The added remark in v. 27 is that in Goshen Jacob’s family were fruitful and became very numerous. The combination of pārá and rāḇá has been common in Genesis (1:28) is the first). In Genesis these verbs normally describe a goal. Here they describe a fait accompli. Even in Egypt God’s blessings are on his own. Jacob blessed Pharaoh (vv. 7, 10), one result of which is spelled out in vv. 13–26. Now it is God who is blessing Jacob. Of course, v. 27b goes well beyond Jacob’s own generation, and even that of his children. Although they are aliens in a strange land, and although they are surrounded by famine, the Israelites are blessed. Neither geography nor natural catastrophe can throttle God’s commitment to his own. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 622–623). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

28 The famine is over by now. Joseph is even further consolidated in his position of authority, and the text is now ready to describe Jacob’s last days. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 623). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

29  Jacob/Israel is now on the verge of death. He has one final request. He does not want to be buried in Egypt. Moses will forsake Egypt alive. Jacob will forsake Egypt dead. Who better to make sure that his father’s remains do not stay in Egypt than Joseph? Joseph has the authority, and the remaining sons have done little to bolster Jacob’s confidence in them.
To guarantee that Joseph will fulfill his request, Jacob asks Joseph to place his hand under Jacob’s thigh (genitals?) and promise to take Jacob’s remains from Egypt. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 623–624). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

1 So Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they possess, have come from the land of Canaan. They are now in the land of Goshen.” 
2 And from among his brothers he took five men and presented them to Pharaoh. 
3 Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, as our fathers were.” 
4 They said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land, for there is no pasture for your servants’ flocks, for the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. And now, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” 

with their flocks and herds. Joseph emphasizes that his family are shepherds to assure the Pharaoh that they entertain no social or political ambitions and to preserve them from an alien way of life and intermarriage with the Egyptians (see 34:9). The latter threat was more acute with the possession of property in Egypt (see 47:11). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 586). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.


To whom did Joseph present some of his brothers, and what request did they make? (Think: Could Joseph have decided this himself? Why do it this way?) (v. 1-4)

Joseph presented five of brothers to Pharaoh
They asked Pharaoh to allow them to dwell in the land of Goshen



5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 
6 The land of Egypt is before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them settle in the land of Goshen, and if you know any able men among them, put them in charge of my livestock.” 

What decision did Pharaoh make regarding living arrangements for Joseph’s family? (v. 5-6)

Pharaoh allowed them to settle in the best of the land of Goshen
Pharaoh is magnanimous. His offer (vv. 5–6) goes beyond the request of Joseph’s brothers in v. 4. 
They had asked only for permission to sojourn in the land, and to dwell in Goshen. 
Pharaoh’s words The land of Egypt lies open to you. In the choice parts of the land settle your father are, in the words of the NT, “immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine” (Eph. 3:20, NIV). His words also evidence his benignity toward Joseph. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 608). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

What work did Pharaoh request Joseph's’ family to do for him? (v. 6)

To take care of his livestock
put them in charge. Egyptian inscriptions frequently mention superintendents—often foreigners—of the royal cattle. Within their own trade, Joseph’s brothers can advance themselves in Pharaoh’s royal administration and enjoy privileges and protection not normally accorded aliens.

the needs of God’s people were being met. God had worked all things out for good: He had exalted Joseph and prepared Pharaoh’s heart for this very moment. Jacob and his family had obeyed God; they had gone down into Egypt. Now God was using Pharaoh and His servant Joseph to meet the needs of His dear people.

7 Then Joseph brought in Jacob his father and stood him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
8 And Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many are the days of the years of your life?” 
9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojourning are 130 years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their sojourning.” 
10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.

How old are you? The question is perhaps prompted by a blessing of longevity from Jacob or possibly marks the honor of Jacob’s long life and many children. Egyptians were preoccupied with death, and the pharaohs, who professed to be eternal, sought to immortalize their bodies. Jacob at 130—and he will live another seventeen years (47:28)—already exceeds the ideal Egyptian life span of 110 years (see 50:22). His age must impress Pharaoh. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 587). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

What did Jacob do for Pharaoh (v. 7)? (Think: What does this show about Jacob and Pharaoh — see Hebrews 7:7?)

Jacob blessed Pharaoh
Pharaoh has enriched Jacob’s family. 
He has promoted son Joseph to a prominent position in Egypt. 
On several occasions he has sent much-needed grain back to Canaan with Jacob’s other sons. 
He has invited Jacob and his family to Egypt with freedom to settle anywhere. 
Jacob is profoundly grateful for the assistance Pharaoh has provided. The appropriate response is to bless Pharaoh. “He has enriched us. May God enrich him.” Vv. 13–26, which detail Joseph’s agrarian reforms, serve as a stunning illustration of the consequence of Jacob’s blessing on Pharaoh. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 610–611). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.


What did Pharaoh ask Jacob, and what did Jacob answer? (v. 9)

Pharaoh asked Jacob how old was he. Jacob answered that the days of his sojourning were 130 years
Jacob’s concern is that his life thus far has been difficult. 
When we first encountered Jacob, he was struggling inside his mother’s womb with his twin brother. 
As we come to the end of Jacob’s life, he is struggling for his life in a famine-devastated Canaan. 
In between these first and last moments of struggle have been many trying experiences for Jacob. His life has had more sorrow than joy. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 612). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.


11 Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 
12 And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household with food, according to the number of their dependents. 

the land of Rameses. Following Pharaoh’s orders, Joseph settles his family in Goshen, identified here as the region of Rameses. This phrase appears to be an editorial comment, for this terminology was not used until the thirteenth-century pharaohs of the 19th Dynasty. The region of Rameses (cf. Exod. 1:11; 12:37; Num. 33:3, 5) may be identified with Qantir or Tanis in the northeastern delta of the Nile. It became the residence city of the kings of the 19th Dynasty and was built by and named after Ramses II (1304–1227 b.c.). 

Special Assignment: How would the arrangement, as described in vv 11,12, fit God’s promise to Abraham and the overall plan of the Bible?
Joseph exceeds the brothers’ original request. They would be content to sojourn (gûr) in Goshen. Instead, Joseph gives them property (ʾaḥuzzá). All of this confirms God’s promise to Jacob that he would make of Jacob a great nation in Egypt (46:3).


13 Now there was no food in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished by reason of the famine. 
14 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, in exchange for the grain that they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 
15 And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? For our money is gone.” 
16 And Joseph answered, “Give your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, if your money is gone.” 
17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks, the herds, and the donkeys. He supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. 
18 And when that year was ended, they came to him the following year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord that our money is all spent. The herds of livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our land. 
19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for food, and we with our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.” 
20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for all the Egyptians sold their fields, because the famine was severe on them. The land became Pharaoh’s. 
21 As for the people, he made servants of them from one end of Egypt to the other. 
22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a fixed allowance from Pharaoh and lived on the allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land. 
23 Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, I have this day bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Now here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. 
24 And at the harvests you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four fifths shall be your own, as seed for the field and as food for yourselves and your households, and as food for your little ones.” 
25 And they said, “You have saved our lives; may it please my lord, we will be servants to Pharaoh.” 
26 So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh’s. 

What did the people do at first to obtain grain (vv 13,14)?
Plan one was to allow the people to purchase grain with money.

What did the people do next to obtain grain (vv. 15-17)?

Plan two was to allow the people to purchase grain with their livestock (vv. 15–17). 
Remember, the famine lasted seven full years. 
Eventually the people’s money was all spent; therefore, Joseph had to devise another plan to save the people. 
He set up a barter system whereby they could exchange their livestock for grain. 
Note that this carried most of the people through another year of famine (v. 17).

How did the people next obtain grain (vv 18,19)? Whose idea was this?

Plan 3 was to allow the people to swap their land and personal labor for grain
Note that this proposal was made a year later and that it was made by the people themselves.

Whose land was not taken? Why not?

The priests’ land was not taken because Pharaoh provided them a fixed allowance of grain.

What arrangement did Joseph establish with the people in vv 23-26? How did the people react?

He arranged for them to sow the land and give a fifth of the harvest to Pharaoh
a fifth. Joseph took a 20 percent tax during the years of abundance to provide for the future. Now he takes a 20 percent royal tax for the privilege to farm the crown land and for the starting seed. By ancient Near Eastern standards, 20 percent interest is low; the average was 33 1/3 percent.
They expressed  gratitude to Joseph
The people are evidently grateful for this arrangement, for they say to Joseph, You have rescued our lives (v. 25). Joseph is a nondiscriminating savior. His concern for Egyptians is no less than his concern for his own family. 

Case Study: Suppose someone says that Joseph was cruel to take the people’s possessions and make them servants. How would you respond?

Joseph is not a callous, unethical taskmaster. 
True, the people forfeit ownership of their land to Pharaoh, but Joseph allows them, when this measure can be put into practice, to keep 80 percent of the harvest for themselves. 
Only 20 percent remains Pharaoh’s. (Cf. the 10 percent that is Yahweh’s in OT religion.) 
And apparently Joseph’s reforms were acceptable to later Egyptians as well, or at least to later Pharaohs. 
Joseph’s decree was still a law in Egypt in the writer’s day (still in force today, v. 26). Joseph’s reforms outlived Joseph. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 618–619). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

The result of Joseph’s ministry upon Israel, those who followed the true and living God, was that they prospered and grew. 
The point is this: Joseph had the privilege of helping and ministering to the people of his day because he had followed God, truly followed God. 
God was, therefore, able to use Joseph to help both his family and the people of his day. 
In fact, Joseph is still helping people today by the dynamic example he set for us—all because he followed God so closely, obeyed Him in all things.
Thought 1. What happens when we do God’s will? We will be given opportunity to help others, to serve and minister to them. 
If we will follow God—truly follow Him—He will use us to help others, use us mightily. 
But note: God will not use a dirty vessel. The vessel has to be clean and holy. 
We must obey God, diligently seek to obey Him in all things. Then and only then will God use us to truly help others. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 379–380). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

27 Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied greatly. 
28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years. 
29 And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal kindly and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt, 
30 but let me lie with my fathers. Carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.” He answered, “I will do as you have said.” 
31 And he said, “Swear to me”; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed.

How long did Jacob live in Egypt? How old was he when he died? (v. 28) 
Jacob lived in Egypt 17 years. He died age 147

What promise did Jacob require Joseph to make? (v. 29-30)

He required Joseph to promise to bury him in Canaan with his fathers
Do not bury me in Egypt. Jacob’s reason is bound up in the Lord’s promise to the fathers (see 48:21; cf. 50:24). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 592). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

Why was it so important to Jacob that his body be returned to Canaan, the promised land, to be buried with Abraham and Isaac?

First, because Jacob believed the great promises of God, the promises that God had made to Abraham and to Isaac and to himself on at least two different occasions. (See outline and notes—Ge. 28:12–15; 35:9–12.)
⇒	He believed the promise of the promised seed, that Israel would one day become a great nation of people and through Israel God would send the very special seed, the Savior of the world. (See notes—Ge. 12:2–3; 12:3 for more discussion.)
⇒	He believed in the promised land, that God was going to give the promised land to the people of God, those who believed in the true and living God. (See note—Ge. 12:1c for more discussion.)

Jacob was declaring his faith in these promises by asking for his body to be returned to the promised land. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 383). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Jacob was acting in faith, faith in God’s great promises. (He. 11:21).

Research Jacob’s burial place, and explain what you can learn about it.

This is the cave of Machpelah (see 50:12–14). By faith Israel stakes his destiny in the sworn land, not in an embalmed body in the best land of Egypt (see 47:11; 50:2). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 592). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.</Text>

livestock. Here the reference is to cattle, not sheep as in 46:32, 34. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 586). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

7 blessed. This could be translated “greeted” (see 27:23). Such a greeting entails pronouncements of blessing. The sons do not bless Pharaoh at their meeting; only the patriarch does that. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 587). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

8. How old are you? The question is perhaps prompted by a blessing of longevity from Jacob or possibly marks the honor of Jacob’s long life and many children. Egyptians were preoccupied with death, and the pharaohs, who professed to be eternal, sought to immortalize their bodies. Jacob at 130—and he will live another seventeen years (47:28)—already exceeds the ideal Egyptian life span of 110 years (see 50:22). His age must impress Pharaoh. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 587). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

9. Jacob said. He does not exalt himself above Pharaoh, but he also does not refer to himself as Pharaoh’s servant, as his sons did three times. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 587). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

Hospitality
The hospitality initiated in the previous scene continues. Pharaoh carries out his promise by legitimizing the presence of the Israelites in Egypt and giving them “the best of the land of Egypt.” In Hamilton’s words, “[T]heir feet have hardly touched Egyptian soil, and already they are tantalized with the possibility of being placed in charge of royal cattle.” In response to Pharaoh’s mercy, the patriarch Jacob blesses him, presumably with longevity and certainly with prosperity.
Suffering and Joy
The suffering of Jacob’s family has been deep. Jacob characterizes his pilgrimage as “difficult.” Joseph, who once “pleaded for his life” from a pit, has experienced great injustice. These saints greet relief from their sufferings, when wrongs have been righted, with deep emotion. Joseph, the imperial leader, is often overcome by tears (42:24; 43:30; 45:14; 50:1, 17). He openly clasps his family to him. As Hamilton says, “Tears of sorrow (ch. 37) are replaced by tears of joy (ch. 46).” These saints are not stoic but are robust and authentic in expressing their emotions. It is a sign of their strength, not weakness. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 588). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

22. did not buy the land of the priests. Only the Egyptian priests and Israel, which will become a kingdom of priests, escape serfdom. Joseph is related to both: to Israel by blood, to the priests by marriage.
23. I have bought you and your land … here is seed. He reduces them to tenant farmers on state land. Nevertheless, the narrator represents them grateful to keep 80 percent of the crop.
24. a fifth. Joseph took a 20 percent tax during the years of abundance to provide for the future. Now he takes a 20 percent royal tax for the privilege to farm the crown land and for the starting seed. By ancient Near Eastern standards, 20 percent interest is low; the average was 33 1/3 percent.
25. saved our lives. The Egyptians do not regard Joseph as a tyrant but as a savior (see 45:7; 47:15, 19). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 590–591). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

26. still in force today. See 1 Sam. 30:25. The coda assures the historicity of the narrative and contrasts the Egyptian state control of the land with Israel’s ideal of private ownership of the land as a usufruct from God (e.g., 1 Sam. 8:13–16). Israel dreaded a monarchy that would insist on a royal double tithe. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 591). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

29 Do not bury me in Egypt. Jacob’s reason is bound up in the Lord’s promise to the fathers (see 48:21; cf. 50:24). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 592). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

c. Pharaoh turned to Joseph and gave him two instructions (v. 5):
⇒	to settle his family wherever he wished, in the best part of the land, in Goshen—if that was his desire (v. 6).
⇒	to put them in charge of his own livestock (v. 7).
The point is this: the needs of God’s people were being met. God had worked all things out for good: He had exalted Joseph and prepared Pharaoh’s heart for this very moment. Jacob and his family had obeyed God; they had gone down into Egypt. Now God was using Pharaoh and His servant Joseph to meet the needs of His dear people.
Thought 1. What happens when we do God’s will? Our needs are met. God will always meet our needs if we will only obey Him. But obedience—doing exactly what God says—is essential. Just think! There is provision to meet every need we have. There is no reason for us to ever have a need that goes unmet. God will meet our needs if we will only turn to Him and follow His will. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 377–378). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

11-27
b. Joseph ministered to others: he devised six plans to meet the desperate needs of the Egyptian people (vv. 13–26). The famine was severe: all of Egypt and Canaan were wasting away. There were no crops and no food to be found any place throughout all the land. The only food available was the food that Joseph had led the nation to store away in warehouses during the seven years of plenty. (See note—Ge. 41:46–49 for more discussion.) Joseph devised six plans to save the people from starvation.
1)	Plan one was to allow the people to purchase grain with money. (See outline and note—Ge. 41:53–57 for discussion.)
2)	Plan two was to allow the people to purchase grain with their livestock (vv. 15–17). Remember, the famine lasted seven full years. Eventually the people’s money was all spent; therefore, Joseph had to devise another plan to save the people. He set up a barter system whereby they could exchange their livestock for grain. Note that this carried most of the people through another year of famine (v. 17). This was a great help to the people, for it meant that the government took over the responsibilities for feeding the livestock. There were, no doubt, thousands of livestock dying from starvation, just as there are in any major famine or drought.
3)	Plan three was to allow the people to swap their land and personal labor for grain (vv. 18–20). Note that this proposal was made a year later and that it was made by the people themselves. Henry Morris paints an excellent picture of this plan:
When they reached this state, the people came to Joseph with a new proposal of their own. Evidently some sort of meeting had been held and spokesmen elected to contract with Joseph on their behalf. They had nothing left which might be marketable except their own lands and their own labor.
The people therefore desired to dedicate themselves and their land for service to Pharaoh in return for food on a regular basis, as well as seed with which to sow their lands. They knew the famine would be over eventually, and they should at least do whatever they could with the land from year to year so that it would eventually be able to yield good crops again, but now they no longer had enough even to purchase seed.
Some people have felt that this was a scheme of Joseph not only to get wealth but also to enslave the people. However, it was their proposal, not Joseph’s, and whatever gain was involved accrued to Pharaoh, not to Joseph. It is true that it created what amounted to a feudalistic economy, but the alternative—that of placing everyone on a dole [free, charitable] system—would have destroyed personal and national morale, would have bankrupted the government, and probably would have culminated in social anarchy. The stores of food would soon have been depleted and mass starvation would have followed.
The people had learned to trust Joseph. He had always charged them a fair price and, even though they had used up all their money and marketable possessions, they still had their self-respect.
4)	Plan four was to move the people into the cities for easier and more economical distribution of the food to them (v. 21). Again Henry Morris has a comment on this plan that is worth our noting.
Joseph relocated many of the people, moving them nearer the various cities where the storehouses were situated. Presumably these people were employed in some form of productive work. The system certainly left something to be desired in terms of human freedom; but a centralized bureaucracy is preferable to mass starvation and anarchy, especially when the bureaucracy is administered intelligently and unselfishly, as it was by Joseph.
5)	Plan five was to leave the priests alone, to let them keep possession of their land (v. 22). Note that this was by order of Pharaoh himself, not by Joseph. Pharaoh needed the priests to give religious encouragement to the people during this most severe crisis. People tend to flock to their religious leaders and houses of worship in severe crises, especially when the crisis lasts on and on, year after year.
6)	Plan six was to make a contract with the people that involved a generous tenant system (vv. 23–26). The people were given seed to plant and harvest. In return for their labor, they were to keep four-fifths (80%) and pay a tax of one fifth (20%) to the government. Again, Henry Morris gives a descriptive picture of the situation.
In effect, this amounted to a permanent annual income tax of 20 percent of gross income. This is not excessive in terms of present-day standards, especially since these farmers had no rent to pay, no cost of investment or upkeep, in fact nothing except their own personal expenses. Pharaoh and the governmental bureaucracy administered by Joseph financed all government functions on the 20 percent. Presumably, a similar and equitable arrangement was provided for those with specific occupations other than farming, including Joseph’s brothers.
It is noteworthy that there was little, if any, complaining about these terms. To the contrary, the citizens were grateful to Joseph for saving their lives, recognizing that they were being treated fairly and generously and that there could really be no other plan which would work as well under the circumstances. They only desired to continue to “find grace,” or favor, in the eyes of Joseph, so that the arrangement would remain in operation.
Note that the tenant system and percentages were still in force in the day of Moses, some four hundred years later (v. 26).
c. The result of Joseph’s ministry upon Israel, those who followed the true and living God, was that they prospered and grew. The point is this: Joseph had the privilege of helping and ministering to the people of his day because he had followed God, truly followed God. God was, therefore, able to use Joseph to help both his family and the people of his day. In fact, Joseph is still helping people today by the dynamic example he set for us—all because he followed God so closely, obeyed Him in all things.

If we will follow God—truly follow Him—He will use us to help others, use us mightily. But note: God will not use a dirty vessel. The vessel has to be clean and holy. We must obey God, diligently seek to obey Him in all things. Then and only then will God use us to truly help others. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).

28-31
Now, why was it so important to Jacob that his body be returned to Canaan, the promised land, to be buried with Abraham and Isaac?
First, because Jacob believed the great promises of God, the promises that God had made to Abraham and to Isaac and to himself on at least two different occasions. (See outline and notes—Ge. 28:12–15; 35:9–12.)
⇒	He believed the promise of the promised seed, that Israel would one day become a great nation of people and through Israel God would send the very special seed, the Savior of the world. (See notes—Ge. 12:2–3; 12:3 for more discussion.)
⇒	He believed in the promised land, that God was going to give the promised land to the people of God, those who believed in the true and living God. (See note—Ge. 12:1c for more discussion.)
Jacob was declaring his faith in these promises by asking for his body to be returned to the promised land. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 383). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Fourth, the stress that Jacob placed upon his body’s being returned to the promised land also shows his great faith in the promises of God. Note how he did all that he could to bind Joseph, to make absolutely sure that Joseph followed through with his promise. Jacob demanded that Joseph both take the oath and swear that he would bury his body in the promised land with the other two fathers who had clung to the great promises of God.
Fifth, note what Jacob did when Joseph took the oath and swore: he bowed and worshipped God (v. 31b). Some translations say that he worshipped while leaning upon his staff (NIV Study Bible). The point to see is that he worshipped God, for he knew that his burial would be a great witness to the great promises of God. In fact, this is exactly what Scripture declares:
⇒	Jacob was acting in faith, faith in God’s great promises.
“By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff” (He. 11:21).
⇒	Abraham had acted in faith, faith in God’s great promises.
“For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God” (He. 11:10).
⇒	Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had all acted in faith, faith in God’s great promises.
“These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city” (He. 11:13–16). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 383–384). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

            <Text>Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh
48 After this, Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is ill.” So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 2 And it was told to Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed. 

Why did Joseph visit Jacob, and whom did he take with him?

Joseph visited Israel because Israel was sick
Joseph took his two sons (Ephraim and Manasseh) with him?
So he took. Joseph consecrates his sons of an Egyptian mother to the God of Israel and his covenant people. 
By bringing his sons to Jacob for this adoption ritual, he corrects any misunderstanding of their names to mean that he either forgot his family (so Manasseh) or that he hoped to be fruitful in the land of Egypt (so Ephraim; see 41:50–52). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 595). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.
Manasseh and Ephraim. The order represents Joseph’s viewpoint that by primogeniture rights the older will be greater than the younger. Jacob will reverse it (48:5, 13–14, 19). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 595). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.


3 And Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, 4 and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’ ” 

What promise did Jacob say God had given him? Where else is this promise recorded? (Think: What is another name for Luz? See map.)

appeared to me. Jacob’s authority to legitimate Joseph’s two sons as numbered among his twelve sons comes from the theophanies given especially to him. Joseph, having never experienced such theophanies, does not have this authority.

God promised to make Jacob fruitful, to multiply his descendants and to give him the land of Canaan 
He repeats the promises of God about fertility, multiplication, that his seed will be an assembly of nations, and finally the promise of land
land … descendants. These are dominant themes of Genesis (see 12:7 and notes).
It is in Canaan, and only in Canaan, that the promises of God can be realized. 
community of peoples. See 28:3 and note. The promise to Israel is narrowed down to Ephraim in 48:19–20. During the divided monarchy (930–722 b.c.) Ephraim’s descendants, as the most powerful tribe, sometimes gave their name to all the peoples that made up the northern kingdom (e.g., Isa. 7:2, 5, 8–9; Hos. 9:13; 12:1, 8). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 596). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.
Promise also found in 35:11-12
He does not say to Joseph: “Son, let me tell you what God did for me at Luz.” Rather, he implies: “Son, let me tell you about our God and the precious promises he made for you, and the family, and our family’s families.”
One should note that many of the promises given at Luz are currently being realized while Jacob’s family is in Egypt. In Egypt they are fertile (or “fruitful,” pārá, 47:27; 48:4). In Egypt they are numerous (or “multiplying,” rāḇá, 47:27; 48:4). In Egypt they are acquiring land as an everlasting holding (ʾḥz, 47:27; 48:4)   
Luz. This is the ancient name of Bethel (see 28:10–22 and notes).

5 And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. 6 And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. 

What promise did Jacob make regarding Joseph’s sons in v5?

Ephraim and Manasseh will become his sons
Jacob elevates Joseph’s two children from grandsons to sons. To make it clear and unmistakable to Joseph what Jacob is doing, Jacob picks out his two oldest children for comparison—Reuben and Simeon. Ephraim and Manasseh may now claim Jacob as “father” as legitimately as any of his other lsons. In one move Joseph’s sons become coinheritors with their uncles!

Are mine. The adoption ritual includes placing them upon his knees, symbolizing his giving them birth in place of Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Intrafamily adoptions are attested in the Bible (cf. Ruth 4:16–17; Esth. 2:7) and in the ancient Near Eastern documents. Mendelsohn cites an Akkadian legal document from Ugarit in which a grandfather adopts his grandson and makes him the heir.170
Ephraim and Manasseh. See 48:1 and note. He names Ephraim first because he intends to put Ephraim first in the blessing (48:19–20).
Reuben and Simeon. 
The first two sons of Leah are singled out because they are being bypassed to give the double portion to Joseph (cf. Gen. 35:23) through the adoption of his two sons. 
The Chronicler explains: “when he [Reuben] defiled his father’s marriage bed, his rights as firstborn were given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel” (1 Chron. 5:1; cf. Gen. 49:3–4). 
5 The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (for he was the firstborn, but because he defiled his father’s couch, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, so that he could not be enrolled as the oldest son; 2 though Judah became strong among his brothers and a chief came from him, yet the birthright belonged to Joseph) (1 Ch 5:1–2).
Simeon and Levi may have been bypassed because of their crimes against Shechem (49:5–6). 
Besides, Joseph is Jacob’s firstborn by Rachel, his favorite wife. Thus Rachel’s firstborn supersedes Leah’s firstborn, and Joseph’s two sons enjoy equal status with Reuben and Simeon among the twelve tribes of Israel. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 596–597). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.
By/under the name. Though reckoned as Joseph’s, they will perpetuate the names of Ephraim and Manasseh (see Gen. 38:8; Deut. 25:5–6). Joseph’s territory could be divided into two tribes because Levi receives no share of the land (Josh. 14:4). The total number of tribal allotments remains twelve. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 597). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.
4 For the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance. (Jos 14:4).

7 As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).

What sad event did Jacob recall in v7, and where and when did it occur?
Jacob recalled the death of his wife Rachel
Rachel died after they left Paddan on the way to Bethlehem
Had Rachel lived longer, she would have given birth to other children. In taking Joseph’s two children, Jacob increases (posthumously) Rachel’s offspring to four. If that is the case, then Rachel’s prayer at the birth of Joseph (“May Yahweh add another son for me,” 30:24b) has been answered with Benjamin, and again with Ephraim and Manasseh. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 630). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

8 When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?” 9 Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.” 10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them. 11 And Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face; and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.” 12 Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 

Two problems arise from this brief verse. 
The first is the apparent contradiction between When Israel saw [wayyarʾ] Joseph’s sons and the statement in v. 10 that Jacob’s eyesight was fading so badly that he was not able to see (lōʾ yûḵal lirʾôṯ). Could he see, or could he not? 
I suggest that vv. 8 and 10 claim retention of some vision for Jacob. He is not totally blind. 
He can pick out two bodies standing by his son. But he cannot recognize them until they are standing right in front of him (the second problem). 
Seventeen years earlier Jacob would have had no need to ask that question. Note that in v. 11 Jacob speaks of his euphoria in “seeing” one more time Joseph’s face. So he is not completely blind.
The second problem is reconciling Jacob’s question “he asked” to Joseph about Joseph’s sons (Who are these?) with the fact that 
(a) 46:5 says that Jacob knew Joseph had two boys, that he knew they were born in Egypt, that he knew their names; and 
(b) 45:28 claims that Jacob had by this time lived in Egypt for seventeen years. Might a grandfather live in one place for almost two decades and not recognize his grandchildren? Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 633). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
More probably, the question to identify the beneficiaries is part of the legal ritual of adoption and/or blessing (cf. 27:18). 
Hamilton explains, “One thinks of the question at a baptism, ‘What name is given to this child?’ or the question at a wedding, ‘Who giveth this woman to this man?’—neither of which is prompted by the ignorance of the clergyperson.” Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 597). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.
God has given me. Joseph recognizes his children as God’s gift. He gives the same answer as Jacob gave Esau to a similar question; he shares his father’s faith (see 33:5; 41:50–52 and note). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 597). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.
from Israel’s knees. The Hebrew literally reads, “from with his knees.” It is highly unlikely that a bedridden, dying old man had twenty-year-old boys on his knees. More probably they were “at/near Israel’s knees.” In any case, it is a legal gesture symbolizing their adoption (see 30:3 and note).
God has let me see your offspring. Jacob is the only patriarch in these narratives who meets and has any dealings with his grandchildren. We do not read of any exchange between Abraham and Isaac’s children, or between Isaac and Jacob’s children. In having this privilege, Jacob is exceeded only by Joseph, who saw perhaps three generations beyond him (50:23). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 635). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
bowed down with his face to the ground. This is contra the dream (37:10). The one equal to the Pharaoh (see 44:18) humbles himself before the patriarch who mediates God’s promises (cf. 24:52; 33:3; 42:6; 43:26). This concludes the adoption ritual. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 598). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near him. 14 And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn). 15 And he blessed Joseph and said, 
		“The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, 
the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day, 
	16 	the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; 
and in them let my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; 
and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.” 

took both of them. The blessing ritual now begins (cf. 48:10).
toward Israel’s right hand. Joseph “stage-manages” the setting to give Manasseh the greater blessing by placing him under the right hand, the position of strength, honor, power, and glory (cf. Ex. 15:6; Ps. 89:13; Prov. 3:16; Eccl. 10:2; Matt. 25:33; Acts 2:33).
Joseph does what he does for two reasons. 
One, he is trying to give his father (with impaired vision) some assistance. He lines the sons up in their correct positions, something that Jacob could not see well enough to do by himself. 
Two, Joseph is a traditionalist. He has no reason to believe that anything out of the normal is about to occur. The subtlety of Jacob naming Ephraim ahead of Manasseh back in v. 5 slipped by Joseph unnoticed, even though Jacob named his own children chronologically—Reuben, then Simeon. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 636). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
crossing his arms. “Jacob may be losing his sight, but he is not losing his insight.” Sternberg reflects, “[T]he blind patriarch shows an insight into the future denied to his clear-sighted (and occasionally clairvoyant) but for once earthbound son.” Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 598–599). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

What blessing did Jacob pronounce on the boys? (v. 15-16) (Think: How does this relate to v5?) 

Jacob’s blessing has three parts to it: 
(1) the invocation of God (vv. 15–16a); 
The first half of the blessing (vv. 15–16a) is actually a testimony covering three generations. 
First Jacob bears witness to the religious devotion of his father and grandfather. 
They walked before God. How appropriate it is for one grandfather, now a father who is blessing his (grand)children, to recall his own father and grandfather. 
So, Jacob begins by highlighting the God of his fathers and the obedience they lived out before that God. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 637). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
(2) the prayer for blessing (v. 16b); and 
Jacob’s other hoped-for result is that his name, and the names of his father and grandfather, will live on (lit., “be named, called, recalled”) in Ephraim and Manasseh. In other words, his prayer is that from this time on Ephraim and Manasseh will be known as sons of Jacob.
⇒	Jacob asked God to make sure that they were called Israel, that they were accepted as true sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This was the formal statement of adoption whereby the two sons would always be acknowledged as true sons of Jacob. They were thereby to inherit the promised land, their portion of the great promise of God.
(3) the results of the blessing and the prayer (v. 16c, d).
One result relates directly to the sons themselves. To be blessed means to multiply, to be fertile. What God had promised to Jacob (hirbîṯiḵā, 48:4) Jacob wants to see realized in these two lads (yiḏgû lārōḇ). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 638). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
⇒	Jacob asked God to make them a great multitude of people, that they be a part of the promised seed, the great nation of believers that God had promised (v. 16c). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 386). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

In one breath Jacob refers to God (v. 15b) and in the next breath to The angel (v. 16a). 
In the Genesis narratives an angel, or heavenly messenger, appears at moments fraught with danger and turmoil—
Hagar alone in a desert (16:7–11); Hagar with a near-dead son in the desert (21:17); 
Abraham holding a knife over Isaac (22:11–18); 
a servant making a long journey to another country (24:7, 40); 
Jacob preparing to leave his father-in-law (31:11); 
Jacob alone by a river, running from Laban and frightened by the prospects of meeting Esau (32:25–31 [Eng. 24–30]). 
No wonder then that Jacob would here speak of the angel who delivers him from every distress (mikkol-rāʿ). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 637–638). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
17 When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 18 And Joseph said to his father, “Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head.” 19 But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.” 20 So he blessed them that day, saying, 
		“By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, 
		‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.’ ” 
Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 21 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers. 22 Moreover, I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.”  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ge 48:1–22). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.


 Describe how Jacob placed his hands on the sons’ heads. What did Joseph say about it? (v. 17-18)

Jacob, crossing his hands, laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim and his left on the head of Manasseh
Joseph got upset and tried to switch Jacob’s hands saying, “Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head.”
For one of the few times in his life, Joseph is wrong in his assumption that here protocol should be followed. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 640). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.


What was the significance of where Jacob placed his hands? What were the consequences to the sons?

The younger (Ephraim) received the birthright
Ephraim would be greater than Manasseh
his younger brother. God’s ways in sovereign grace override human ways of social convention (see Isa. 55:8–9)—
Seth over Cain, 
Isaac versus Ishmael, 
Jacob versus Esau, 
Perez versus Zerah, 
Joseph versus Reuben, and 
Ephraim versus Manasseh. 
God was demonstrating two great truths: His sovereignty and His grace.
1. There was God’s sovereignty. 
Man has tended toward choosing the older child to take on the responsibility for the family when needed, not always, but usually. 
But God knows the human heart, and He has the right as God to choose any person He wants. 
Therefore, when He chose the younger son, God’s sovereignty was honored and man’s evaluation and plans were humbled.
2. There was God’s grace. 
God’s grace is always seen when He chooses the younger son. If the laws and customs of men were followed, the younger son would never receive the greater blessings. 
If he ever received them, it was because man’s law and custom were bypassed. Therefore, when the younger son received the greater blessing, it was being freely given to him. 
The blessing was given by grace, entirely undeserved, unmerited, and unearned by law. The younger son received the greater blessing simply because God freely chose him to receive them.
This meant that he owed all the blessings to God. All that he had belonged and was due to God, not to himself nor to any other person. (See note, pt. 2—Ge. 25:23; also see notes—Ro. 9:7–13 for more discussion.) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 387). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
will be greater than he. See 25:25 and note. 
In the census taken in the second year after the Exodus, the male population of Ephraim is 20 percent more than that of Manasseh (see Num. 1:33, 35). 
In the second census a generation later, however, the male population of Manasseh exceeds that of Ephraim (Num. 26:34, 37) by 40 percent (cf. 1 Chron. 7:20–23). 
Eventually, however, Ephraim gains the numerical superiority (cf. Deut. 33:17). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 600). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.
Jacob realize the nature of the special and favored role that will be assigned to Ephraim. Ephraim shall be greater than Manasseh, and his descendants will be exceedingly numerous, as his name suggests. In other words, the difference between Ephraim and Manasseh is a comparative one. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 641). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Thought 1. The point to see is Jacob’s great affection and the great blessings he pronounced upon his son and his two grandsons. Jacob’s affection and blessing are a living example for us. We should all lead our children and grandchildren to trust God, and we should ask God to bless them richly. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 387). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

What assurance did Jacob have regarding his family after he died (v. 21)? (Think: How does v. 22 relate to v. 5?)

Jacob assured Joseph that God would be with him and return him to the promised land (v. 21). Jacob knew that God would always be with his son because God had always been with him.
⇒	God had promised to be with Jacob when his brother, Esau, threatened to kill him.
“And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of” (Ge. 28:15).
⇒	God had promised to be with Jacob when God called him to return to the promised land.
“And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee” (Ge. 31:3).
⇒	God had protected Jacob from harm by His presence.
“And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me” (Ge. 31:5).
⇒	Jacob never forgot that God’s presence had always been with him, providing and protecting him.
“And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went” (Ge. 35:3).

            <Text>3-4 Jacob’s repetition of this particular encounter with God may be a gentle reminder to Joseph that Egypt is a temporary abode. It is in Canaan, and only in Canaan, that the promises of God can be realized. What God has graciously done for his people in Egypt is but a foretaste of what he will do for them in Canaan. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 629). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

5  Jacob started talking about the past (vv. 3–4). He now shifts to the future (vv. 5–6). He will return to the past in v. 7. Most certainly surprising Joseph, Jacob elevates Joseph’s two children from grandsons to sons. To make it clear and unmistakable to Joseph what Jacob is doing, Jacob picks out his two oldest children for comparison—Reuben and Simeon. Ephraim and Manasseh may now claim Jacob as “father” as legitimately as any of his other sons. In one move Joseph’s sons become coinheritors with their uncles! This is, of course, the event that explains why, in subsequent times, the descendants of Joseph held two tribal allotments, rather than Joseph himself. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 629). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

No reason is given for Jacob’s action, but a partial explanation will be provided in vv. 8ff. What is his motive? What is Joseph’s response? Joseph knows what it means to be elevated. He has gone from a household slave to Pharaoh’s majordomo. Now his sons will experience an elevation of their own. Jacob has other grandsons with him in Goshen, fifty-one to be exact. Is not this act by Jacob a final demonstration of his gratitude to Joseph? By making Joseph’s sons Jacob’s sons, Jacob is in effect elevating Joseph to the level of himself. That is, both men are now ancestral fathers of the tribes of Israel that will come from them. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 630). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

7  Again Jacob relives a past event, the death of his beloved wife Rachel as they traveled from Paddan(-aram) back to Canaan (35:16–20). A dying man talks about a dead woman. It is not clear why Jacob recalls Rachel’s death and shares it with Joseph.  Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 630). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

It may be that we should see some connection between Jacob’s appropriation of Joseph’s children as his own and his recall of his wife’s death. Had Rachel lived longer, she would have given birth to other children. In taking Joseph’s two children, Jacob increases (posthumously) Rachel’s offspring to four. If that is the case, then Rachel’s prayer at the birth of Joseph (“May Yahweh add another son for me,” 30:24b) has been answered with Benjamin, and again with Ephraim and Manasseh. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 630). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

8  Two problems arise from this brief verse. The first is the apparent contradiction between When Israel saw [wayyarʾ] Joseph’s sons and the statement in v. 10 that Jacob’s eyesight was fading so badly that he was not able to see (lōʾ yûḵal lirʾôṯ). Could he see, or could he not? The second problem is reconciling Jacob’s question to Joseph about Joseph’s sons (Who are these?) with the fact that (a) 46:5 says that Jacob knew Joseph had two boys, that he knew they were born in Egypt, that he knew their names; and (b) 45:28 claims that Jacob had by this time lived in Egypt for seventeen years. Might a grandfather live in one place for almost two decades and not recognize his grandchildren? Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 633). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

To respond to the first issue, I suggest that vv. 8 and 10 claim retention of some vision for Jacob. He is not totally blind. He can pick out two bodies standing by his son. But he cannot recognize them until they are standing right in front of him (the second problem). Seventeen years earlier Jacob would have had no need to ask that question. Note that in v. 11 Jacob speaks of his euphoria in “seeing” one more time Joseph’s face. So he is not completely blind.

It may also be that Jacob’s question should be understood as part of the formal prelude to the forthcoming blessing. That prelude includes formal recognition by Joseph that the young men are his sons. One thinks of the question at a baptism, “What name is given to this child?” or the question at a wedding, “Who giveth this woman to this man?”—neither of which is prompted by the ignorance of the clergyperson.

The only other possible solution is to suppose that these verses have been artificially placed in their current position (i.e., at Jacob’s deathbed), but that their original position was at some point shortly after Jacob arrives in Egypt, say, around 46:30. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 633–634). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

10 Before Jacob blesses his grandchildren he shows his affections for them by kissing and embracing them. (These two verbs were used in 33:4 when Esau and Jacob were united with each other after a long separation.) Jacob may be losing his eyesight, but he is not losing his emotional attachment to his family.  Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 634). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

11 Jacob may lament that his days have been few and evil, and that he has not lived as long or as well as his father and grandfather (47:9). Yet Jacob is the only patriarch in these narratives who meets and has any dealings with his grandchildren. We do not read of any exchange between Abraham and Isaac’s children, or between Isaac and Jacob’s children. In having this privilege, Jacob is exceeded only by Joseph, who saw perhaps three generations beyond him (50:23). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 635). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

12  If Joseph removes Ephraim and Manasseh from Jacob’s knees, then that would indicate that they were still relatively small and young, little lads. In fact, they must be near twenty, for they were born to Joseph before Jacob came to Egypt seventeen years earlier. It is unlikely that a bedridden, elderly, blind, and sickly man could support two young men on his knees. The phrase must mean, then, that Ephraim and Manasseh stood by their grandfather’s bed, near his knees. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 635). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

13 Of course, Joseph does what he does for two reasons. One, he is trying to give his father (with impaired vision) some assistance. He lines the sons up in their correct positions, something that Jacob could not see well enough to do by himself. Two, Joseph is a traditionalist. He has no reason to believe that anything out of the normal is about to occur. The subtlety of Jacob naming Ephraim ahead of Manasseh back in v. 5 slipped by Joseph unnoticed, even though Jacob named his own children chronologically—Reuben, then Simeon. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 636). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

14  To the surprise of everybody, Jacob crosses his hands and places his right hand on the younger boy and his left hand on the older boy. From this action of Jacob comes the eventual precedence of Ephraim over Manasseh. Jacob may be losing his sight, but he is not losing his insight. For some undisclosed reason Jacob ignores the law of primogeniture. Manasseh thus joins a long list of firstborn in Genesis who for one reason or other are passed by—Cain, Ishmael, Esau, Reuben, and Zerah. The text is strangely silent about the stimulus for Jacob’s surprise move. How does he know to cross his hands and bless with the right hand the younger boy? Is he guided by “a supernatural impulse”? Does he do a right thing inadvertently?31 In any case, “the blind patriarch shows an insight into the future denied to his clear-sighted (and occasionally clairvoyant) but for once earthbound son.” Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 636). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Through placing his hands on Joseph’s children, Jacob simply engages in an act by which he designates who the recipients of blessing are, and an act by which the actual blessing is bestowed. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 637). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

15–16  Jacob now pronounces a blessing on his two grandsons. The first half of the blessing (vv. 15–16a) is actually a testimony covering three generations. First Jacob bears witness to the religious devotion of his father and grandfather. They walked before God. How appropriate it is for one grandfather, now a father who is blessing his (grand)children, to recall his own father and grandfather. So, Jacob begins by highlighting the God of his fathers and the obedience they lived out before that God. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 637). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

In one breath Jacob refers to God (v. 15b) and in the next breath to The angel (v. 16a). In the Genesis narratives an angel, or heavenly messenger, appears at moments fraught with danger and turmoil—Hagar alone in a desert (16:7–11); Hagar with a near-dead son in the desert (21:17); Abraham holding a knife over Isaac (22:11–18); a servant making a long journey to another country (24:7, 40); Jacob preparing to leave his father-in-law (31:11); Jacob alone by a river, running from Laban and frightened by the prospects of meeting Esau (32:25–31 [Eng. 24–30]). No wonder then that Jacob would here speak of the angel who delivers him from every distress (mikkol-rāʿ). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 637–638). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Jacob’s blessing has three parts to it: (1) the invocation of God (vv. 15–16a); (2) the prayer for blessing (v. 16b); and (3) the results of the blessing and the prayer (v. 16c, d).
One result relates directly to the sons themselves. To be blessed means to multiply, to be fertile. What God had promised to Jacob (hirbîṯiḵā, 48:4) Jacob wants to see realized in these two lads (yiḏgû lārōḇ).
Jacob’s other hoped-for result is that his name, and the names of his father and grandfather, will live on (lit., “be named, called, recalled”) in Ephraim and Manasseh. In other words, his prayer is that from this time on Ephraim and Manasseh will be known as sons of Jacob. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 638). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

17  Joseph assumes that his father, because of poor eyesight, has mixed up Ephraim and Manasseh. That is why Jacob had to cross his hands, and use his right hand to touch “Manasseh” (in reality, Ephraim).
For one of the few times in his life, Joseph is wrong in his assumption that here protocol should be followed. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 640). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

19 Only now does Jacob realize the nature of the special and favored role that will be assigned to Ephraim. Ephraim shall be greater than Manasseh, and his descendants will be exceedingly numerous, as his name suggests. In other words, the difference between Ephraim and Manasseh is a comparative one. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 641). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

22  To conclude, Jacob gives to Joseph a piece of property (šeḵem) above and beyond what he is giving to his other sons. Part of the enigma of this verse is the qualifying phrase which I captured from the Amorites with my sword and bow. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 642). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

In a chapter given over to a narration of the preferential status of of Ephraim over his brothers, the concluding note is one about Joseph’s preferential status over his brothers. Joseph is to his eleven brothers as Ephraim is to Manasseh. Although the family is miles away from Canaan, Jacob deeds a bit of it to Joseph. Jacob started a lot of problems by an extra gift to Joseph—the multicolored coat, which created friction. For a second time Jacob gives to Joseph an extra gift: one mountain slope. We know how the brothers reacted to the coat. We do not know how they reacted to the gift of real estate. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 644). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

            <Text>1 So he took. Joseph consecrates his sons of an Egyptian mother to the God of Israel and his covenant people. By bringing his sons to Jacob for this adoption ritual, he corrects any misunderstanding of their names to mean that he either forgot his family (so Manasseh) or that he hoped to be fruitful in the land of Egypt (so Ephraim; see 41:50–52).

Manasseh and Ephraim. The order represents Joseph’s viewpoint that by primogeniture rights the older will be greater than the younger. Jacob will reverse it (48:5, 13–14, 19). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 595). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

community of peoples. See 28:3 and note. The promise to Israel is narrowed down to Ephraim in 48:19–20. During the divided monarchy (930–722 b.c.) Ephraim’s descendants, as the most powerful tribe, sometimes gave their name to all the peoples that made up the northern kingdom (e.g., Isa. 7:2, 5, 8–9; Hos. 9:13; 12:1, 8). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 596). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

reckoned as mine. The adoption ritual includes placing them upon his knees, symbolizing his giving them birth in place of Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. Intrafamily adoptions are attested in the Bible (cf. Ruth 4:16–17; Esth. 2:7) and in the ancient Near Eastern documents. Mendelsohn cites an Akkadian legal document from Ugarit in which a grandfather adopts his grandson and makes him the heir.170
Ephraim and Manasseh. See 48:1 and note. He names Ephraim first because he intends to put Ephraim first in the blessing (48:19–20).
Reuben and Simeon. The first two sons of Leah are singled out because they are being bypassed to give the double portion to Joseph (cf. Gen. 35:23) through the adoption of his two sons. The Chronicler explains: “when he [Reuben] defiled his father’s marriage bed, his rights as firstborn were given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel” (1 Chron. 5:1; cf. Gen. 49:3–4). Simeon and Levi may have been bypassed because of their crimes against Shechem (49:5–6). Besides, Joseph is Jacob’s firstborn by Rachel, his favorite wife. Thus Rachel’s firstborn supersedes Leah’s firstborn, and Joseph’s two sons enjoy equal status with Reuben and Simeon among the twelve tribes of Israel. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 596–597). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

6 under the names. Though reckoned as Joseph’s, they will perpetuate the names of Ephraim and Manasseh (see Gen. 38:8; Deut. 25:5–6). Joseph’s territory could be divided into two tribes because Levi receives no share of the land (Josh. 14:4). The total number of tribal allotments remains twelve. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 597). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

8 he asked. Jacob certainly knows Joseph’s sons; he has proposed adopting them by name! It seems unlikely that he has never met them during his seventeen years in Egypt. Possibly he cannot see clearly. More probably, the question to identify the beneficiaries is part of the legal ritual of adoption and/or blessing (cf. 27:18). Hamilton explains, “One thinks of the question at a baptism, ‘What name is given to this child?’ or the question at a wedding, ‘Who giveth this woman to this man?’—neither of which is prompted by the ignorance of the clergyperson.” Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 597). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

9. God has given me. Joseph recognizes his children as God’s gift. He gives the same answer as Jacob gave Esau to a similar question; he shares his father’s faith (see 33:5; 41:50–52 and note). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 597). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

11. God has allowed me to see your children. The adoption ceremony begins with Joseph crediting God for his sons and ends with Jacob praising God. God blesses both father and grandfather through these boys. To Joseph they are an incredible gift after years of affliction; to Jacob they are an incredible vision after he had lost all hope of ever seeing Joseph. Joseph’s and Jacob’s reflections of God’s present blessings set the spiritual milieu for the blessings that follow.

12. Then Joseph removed them. The adoption ritual is over.

from Israel’s knees. The Hebrew literally reads, “from with his knees.” It is highly unlikely that a bedridden, dying old man had twenty-year-old boys on his knees. More probably they were “at/near Israel’s knees.” In any case, it is a legal gesture symbolizing their adoption (see 30:3 and note).

bowed down with his face to the ground. This is contra the dream (37:10). The one equal to the Pharaoh (see 44:18) humbles himself before the patriarch who mediates God’s promises (cf. 24:52; 33:3; 42:6; 43:26). This concludes the adoption ritual. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 598). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

13. took both of them. The blessing ritual now begins (cf. 48:10).
toward Israel’s right hand. Joseph “stage-manages” the setting to give Manasseh the greater blessing by placing him under the right hand, the position of strength, honor, power, and glory (cf. Ex. 15:6; Ps. 89:13; Prov. 3:16; Eccl. 10:2; Matt. 25:33; Acts 2:33).
14. But Israel reached out. The gesture of blessing differs from the gestures of adoption (cf. 48:10).
crossing his arms. “Jacob may be losing his sight, but he is not losing his insight.” Sternberg reflects, “[T]he blind patriarch shows an insight into the future denied to his clear-sighted (and occasionally clairvoyant) but for once earthbound son.” Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 598–599). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

15 blessed. See 48:3. Jacob blesses as his father had blessed him (27:27–29). In the blessing to be given, Jacob’s perspective shifts from God’s miraculous blessings on him in Egypt in allowing him to see his favored son (see 45:28; 46:30) to the great blessing to come upon Joseph’s sons when they return to the sworn land. By becoming part of the covenant family, Ephraim and Manasseh become heirs to all of its divine blessings of progeny and protection. The blessings are summarized by two epithets of God: Shepherd and Angel. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 599). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

my shepherd. The first of two epithets is an intimate royal metaphor for God that signifies his provision, restoration, and protection (see Ps. 23:1; cf. Gen. 49:24). The aged shepherd acknowledges God’s special shepherding of his life.
16. the Angel. The parallelism strongly suggests equating God with the angel. In other texts the distinction between God and his angel becomes attenuated (see 16:7). The incarnate God wrestled with Jacob and, having heard his cry to be blessed, blessed him and delivered him from Esau (see 32:25–26; cf. Hos. 12:4).
from all harm. This second epithet focuses on God’s protection. Heretofore an angel has appeared in crises (Gen. 16:7–11; 21:17; 22:11–18; 31:11; 32:1–2, 24–30). Jacob has learned the reality of God’s presence through experience (see 28:12; 31:11; 32:1–3, 22–32). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 599). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

greatly. The combined number of males in Ephraim and Manasseh increases from 72,700 (Num. 1:32–35) in the second year after the Exodus to 85,200 forty years later (Num. 26:28–37). By contrast, the combined populations of Reuben and Simeon during the same period of time decreases from 105,800 to 65,930. The tribes of Joseph become the paradigm of spectacular increase (see. Gen. 48:20; cf. Deut. 33:17). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 600). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

19. his father refused. The patriarch, empowered by God, is greater than the ruler of Egypt. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 600). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

his younger brother. God’s ways in sovereign grace override human ways of social convention (see Isa. 55:8–9)—Abel versus Cain, Isaac versus Ishmael, Jacob versus Esau, Perez versus Zerah, Joseph versus Reuben, and Ephraim versus Manasseh. In Genesis, God often chooses the younger son, not the older, to carry the divine family’s heritage (Deut. 33:17).
will be greater than he. See 25:25 and note. In the census taken in the second year after the Exodus, the male population of Ephraim is 20 percent more than that of Manasseh (see Num. 1:33, 35). In the second census a generation later, however, the male population of Manasseh exceeds that of Ephraim (Num. 26:34, 37) by 40 percent (cf. 1 Chron. 7:20–23). Eventually, however, Ephraim gains the numerical superiority (cf. Deut. 33:17). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 600). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

21 as one who is over your brothers, I give the ridge of land. The Hebrew is ambiguous, literally reading, “I give to you Shechem/shoulder over your brother(s).” This may mean: (1) he gives Shechem, including its well, to Joseph, who is above his brother(s) (see Gen. 33:18–19; 37:12, 14; Josh. 24:32; John 4:5); (2) he gives Joseph a ridge—interpreting “shoulder” as a ridge of land; (3) he gives Joseph one more portion—interpreting “shoulder” to be a metonymy for portion—than his brother(s). The first is the best option because the other meanings of šeḵem are unattested and unnecessary. Moreover, as the references cited show, the city is historically connected with Jacob and Joseph.
Amorites. See 15:16. This generic term refers to the pre-Israelite inhabitants of Canaan, including the Hivites (see 34:2). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 601). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

Sovereignty and Sin
If the interpretation of 48:22 offered above is right, Jacob took Shechem through the cruelty of Simeon and Levi without acquitting them. Elsewhere God uses evil to achieve his aims without acquitting the guilty: for example, in his use of unbelieving Israel to establish the monarchy (1 Sam. 8–10); in his use of Assyria to punish Israel (cf. Isa. 10:5–11); in his use of wicked hands to shed the saving blood of Jesus Christ (Acts 2:23; 1 Cor. 2:6–10). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 602).

a. Jacob showed deep affection for his grandchildren, Joseph’s two sons (vv. 8–10). Jacob was almost blind and needed to make sure that the two dim figures standing beside Joseph were his two sons. Thus, he asked who they were (v. 8).
⇒	When Joseph identified them, Jacob asked that he bring them to him, by his knees, so he could bless them (v. 9).
⇒	When Joseph moved his sons forward to his father, Jacob took them in his arms and kissed them (v. 10).
⇒	Jacob then expressed his deep affection for Joseph and his sons (v. 11). He had never expected to see Joseph, much less any sons of Joseph. But now, God had not only allowed him to see Joseph again, but God had given him the great privilege of seeing the two sons of Joseph.
⇒	When Joseph heard this, he was so emotionally moved that he pulled his two sons back from his father’s knees, and he himself bowed in respect before his father (v. 12). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 385). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

d. Jacob began the blessing by calling upon God (v. 15). Note exactly whom he was calling upon: not some false god, but the true God.
1)	Jacob called upon the God before whom Abraham and Isaac walked (v. 15). This was the true God: the God who had revealed Himself to Abraham and Isaac. Abraham and Isaac had not followed after some false god: they were followers of the true God of heaven and earth. They knew Him personally, for He had revealed Himself to them. They had actually talked with Him. And they had sought to walk and to live holy lives before Him. Jacob was calling upon the true God to bless Joseph and his two sons.
2)	Jacob called upon the God who had fed him and been his shepherd throughout life (v. 15b). The Hebrew word for fed me or shepherd is the same (Roeh or Raah). Jacob was calling upon the God who had looked after and taken care of him: the God who had fed, guided, protected, and saved him, who had made provision for every need he had. Jacob was calling upon the Shepherd of the universe to look after Joseph and his two sons. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 385–386). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

e. Jacob asked God to bless Joseph and his two sons by doing two things for them (v. 16b).
⇒	Jacob asked God to make sure that they were called Israel, that they were accepted as true sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This was the formal statement of adoption whereby the two sons would always be acknowledged as true sons of Jacob. They were thereby to inherit the promised land, their portion of the great promise of God.
⇒	Jacob asked God to make them a great multitude of people, that they be a part of the promised seed, the great nation of believers that God had promised (v. 16c). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 386). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

21-22

i. Jacob then turned to Joseph himself to bless him (vv. 21–22).
1)	Jacob assured Joseph that God would be with him and return him to the promised land (v. 21). Jacob knew that God would always be with his son because God had always been with him.
⇒	God had promised to be with Jacob when his brother, Esau, threatened to kill him.
“And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of” (Ge. 28:15).
⇒	God had promised to be with Jacob when God called him to return to the promised land.
“And the Lord said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee” (Ge. 31:3).
⇒	God had protected Jacob from harm by His presence.
“And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me” (Ge. 31:5).
⇒	Jacob never forgot that God’s presence had always been with him, providing and protecting him.
“And let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went” (Ge. 35:3).

Thought 1. The point to see is Jacob’s great affection and the great blessings he pronounced upon his son and his two grandsons. Jacob’s affection and blessing are a living example for us. We should all lead our children and grandchildren to trust God, and we should ask God to bless them richly. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 387).

Deeper Study # 1
(48:17–18) Blessings—Birthright—Firstborn—Sovereignty, Of God—Grace: in Jacob’s day, the firstborn was always to receive the best—a double portion—of the family’s inheritance and blessing. But often, in God’s sovereignty, the younger son was chosen to be more greatly used in God’s purposes. This is one of the facts immediately noticed throughout Scripture.
⇒	Seth was chosen before Cain.
⇒	Shem was chosen before Japheth.
⇒	Abraham was chosen before Haran.
⇒	Isaac was chosen before Ishmael.
⇒	Jacob was chosen before Esau.
⇒	Ephraim was chosen before Manasseh.
⇒	Moses was chosen before his brother.
⇒	Gideon was chosen before his brothers.
⇒	David was chosen before his brothers.
In each of these cases, God was demonstrating two great truths: His sovereignty and His grace.
1. There was God’s sovereignty. Man has tended toward choosing the older child to take on the responsibility for the family when needed, not always, but usually. But God knows the human heart, and He has the right as God to choose any person He wants. Therefore, when He chose the younger son, God’s sovereignty was honored and man’s evaluation and plans were humbled.
2. There was God’s grace. God’s grace is always seen when He chooses the younger son. If the laws and customs of men were followed, the younger son would never receive the greater blessings. If he ever received them, it was because man’s law and custom were bypassed. Therefore, when the younger son received the greater blessing, it was being freely given to him. The blessing was given by grace, entirely undeserved, unmerited, and unearned by law. The younger son received the greater blessing simply because God freely chose him to receive them.
This meant that he owed all the blessings to God. All that he had belonged and was due to God, not to himself nor to any other person.

            <Text>Jacob Blesses His Sons
49 Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come. 
	2 	“Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob, 
listen to Israel your father. 


	3 	“Reuben, you are my firstborn, 
my might, and the first-fruits of my strength, 
preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. 
	4 	Unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence, 
because you went up to your father’s bed; 
then you defiled it—he went up to my couch! 
	5 	“Simeon and Levi are brothers; 
weapons of violence are their swords. 
	6 	Let my soul come not into their council; 
O my glory, be not joined to their company. 
		For in their anger they killed men, 
and in their willfulness they hamstrung oxen. 
	7 	Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, 
and their wrath, for it is cruel! 
		I will divide them in Jacob 
and scatter them in Israel. 
	8 	“Judah, your brothers shall praise you; 
your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; 
your father’s sons shall bow down before you. 
	9 	Judah is a lion’s cub; 
from the prey, my son, you have gone up. 
		He stooped down; he crouched as a lion 
and as a lioness; who dares rouse him? 
	10 	The scepter shall not depart from Judah, 
nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, 
		until tribute comes to him; 
and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples. 
	11 	Binding his foal to the vine 
and his donkey’s colt to the choice vine, 
		he has washed his garments in wine 
and his vesture in the blood of grapes. 
	12 	His eyes are darker than wine, 
and his teeth whiter than milk. 
	13 	“Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea; 
he shall become a haven for ships, 
and his border shall be at Sidon. 
	14 	“Issachar is a strong donkey, 
crouching between the sheepfolds. 
	15 	He saw that a resting place was good, 
and that the land was pleasant, 
		so he bowed his shoulder to bear, 
and became a servant at forced labor. 
	16 	“Dan shall judge his people 
as one of the tribes of Israel. 
	17 	Dan shall be a serpent in the way, 
a viper by the path, 
		that bites the horse’s heels 
so that his rider falls backward. 
	18 	I wait for your salvation, O Lord. 
	19 	“Raiders shall raid Gad, 
but he shall raid at their heels. 
	20 	“Asher’s food shall be rich, 
and he shall yield royal delicacies. 
	21 	“Naphtali is a doe let loose 
that bears beautiful fawns. 
	22 	“Joseph is a fruitful bough, 
a fruitful bough by a spring; 
his branches run over the wall. 
	23 	The archers bitterly attacked him, 
shot at him, and harassed him severely, 
	24 	yet his bow remained unmoved; 
his arms were made agile 
		by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob 
(from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel), 
	25 	by the God of your father who will help you, 
by the Almighty who will bless you 
with blessings of heaven above, 
		blessings of the deep that crouches beneath, 
blessings of the breasts and of the womb. 
	26 	The blessings of your father 
are mighty beyond the blessings of my parents, 
up to the bounties of the everlasting hills. 
		May they be on the head of Joseph, 
and on the brow of him who was set apart from his brothers. 
	27 	“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, 
in the morning devouring the prey 
and at evening dividing the spoil.” 
Jacob’s Death and Burial
28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him. 29 Then he commanded them and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30 in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. 31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah— 32 the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites.” 33 When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people.

            <Title>Gen 49 Hamilton</Title>
            <Text>1 What he is about to share with them is in the form of an inspired prophecy about the destiny of each son as extended into the tribe emanating from that son. Each saying has to do with the coming days (beʾaḥarîṯ hayyāmîm). This expression occurs thirteen times in the OT, eight of which are in the prophetic books (nine if one includes Daniel). Of these texts, the most similar to Gen. 49:1 is Deut. 31:29 (and the surrounding verses). Both begin with a command to assemble (hēʾāsep̄û [Gen. 49:1], hiqqāḇeṣû [Gen. 49:2]; haqhîlû [Deut. 31:28]). Both contain the expression “in the coming days.” In both someone is told to listen to what is about to be said (šimʿû [Gen. 49:1, 2]; tišmaʿ [Deut. 32:1]). Thus Jacob addressing his sons is comparable to Moses addressing the assembly of Israel. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 646). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

3–4  The saying directed to Reuben has two parts. The first is a word about privilege. Reuben is Jacob’s firstborn, once a source of inestimable joy to his father. The second is a word about accountability. Because Reuben slept with Jacob’s concubine (35:22), he forfeits all the privileges that go with primogeniture. This forfeiture is fulfilled historically in later times when the Reubenites living in Transjordan are integrated into the tribe of Gad.

From this first oracle the teaching is clear that the behavior of one individual affects the destiny of his descendants. God does visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who live licentiously, as did Reuben (Exod. 20:5). This promise works in a positive direction as well. Recall God’s words to Abraham, “And by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice” (22:18); or God’s words to Isaac, “I will multiply your descendants … because Abraham obeyed my voice” (26:4–5). Or, we may go as far back as the story of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 18–19), which teaches that a nucleus of righteous people guarantees the survival of a city for one’s children and grandchildren. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 647). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

5-7 In his words addressed to Simeon and Levi, Jacob recalls a previous incident in which they were involved, as he did with Reuben. The antecedent for Jacob’s rebuke against sons two and three is obviously the incident recorded in Gen. 34, Simeon’s and Levi’s massacre of the male population of Shechem in retaliation for the humiliation of their sister Dinah. Here is another illustration, as in the Reuben oracle, of the principle that the behavior of one generation affects the circumstances of later generations.
Jacob’s oracle to Simeon and Levi is composed of (a) an address or a heading (v. 5a); (b) an accusation (v. 5b-c); (c) a statement of dissociation from the criminals (v. 6a-b); (d) justification for this dissociation (v. 6d-e); (e) the pronouncement of a curse (v. 7a-b); (f) the particulars of this curse (v. 7c–d). Vv. 5–7b refer to past history. V. 7c–d is future history. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 651). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

It should be observed that Jacob addresses Reuben directly in the second person: “You, Reuben, my firstborn, … you shall no longer excel, For you climbed … you defiled.” But with Simeon and Levi Jacob speaks indirectly in the third person: they destroyed … They treated violently … their council … their company … their anger … they murdered … they hamstrung … their fury … their rage; I will scatter them … I will disperse them. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 651–652). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

The father pronounces a curse on the perpetrator(s) that really touches the perpetrator’s descendants more than the perpetrator himself (Canaan, the tribes of Simeon and Levi).
The second item of interest is Jacob speaking in v. 7c–d as if he were God: I will scatter them … I will disperse them. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 652). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Eventually Simeon is integrated into the tribe of Judah, and hence scatter here means “dissolve.” Levi is dispersed in the sense that the Levites are never given a territory of their own, but are divided up among the remaining tribes. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 652). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

 
8  In the first verse of the oracle Judah is given a more honorable position than his brothers by his brothers. They praise Judah (note the play on sound here—yehûḏá yôḏûḵā) and bow before him. What Jacob raised derogatorily as a possibility with Joseph (37:10) he now affirms with Judah. The reason for the exaltation of Judah is because of Judah’s impressive accomplishments—your hand is on the neck of your enemies Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 657–658). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

9  Here Jacob shifts from a description of what Judah had done to what Judah is like. Judah is described as lionesque.  Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 658). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

10  The crux in vv. 8–12 is v. 10, particularly the third line of the verse. The first two lines suggest that Judah will continue to enjoy eminence, the tribe will never lose its place of primus inter pares, until he possesses that which belongs to him. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 658–659). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Both LXX and 4QPBless would agree then that the phrase be understood as “until he comes to whom it [the scepter, the kingship] belongs.” The Hebrew would have to be read as “until that which is his comes.” If that is what Gen. 49:10 is saying, then we are faced with a Hebrew grammatical anomaly for which the Hebrew Bible offers no parallel. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 661). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

There are, then, four major approaches to Gen. 49:10c: (1) attempt to make sense of MT by retaining “Shiloh”; (2) follow the reading of the ancient versions (“that which is his”); (3) emend šîlōh to šay lōh (“tribute to him”); (4) discover in “Shiloh” some Semitic word meaning “ruler” or “prince.” Of course, many other interpretations have been suggested, including those who see Judah’s son Shelah in Shiloh, and those who resort to yet other redivisioning of the consonants. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 661). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

11-12
If one understands vv. 11 and 12 as further descriptions of the messianic scion mentioned in v. 10, then these two verses would describe the individual’s wealth (v. 11) and his beauty (v. 12). Tethering an ass to a vine (which the ass would readily consume) would be like lighting a cigarette with a dollar bill. Laundering one’s clothing with wine might also point to opulence.
It is clear that wine is not exactly the same as grapes’ blood. The first refers to the finished product. The second refers to the crushing of the grapes. May we have here a pastoral image, but within which there is the intimation of violence? May there be both a laundering of wine and a laundering of blood? To his own this one will bring joy and fullness; to those who reject him he brings terror.
The NT does not appropriate any part of this messianic oracle. The most likely allusion to this text occurs in reference to Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Matt. 21:1–9; Mark 11:1–10; Luke 19:28–38; John 12:12–18). The major OT citation in these passages is Zech. 9:9. One description of the animal on which Jesus sits or rides in Zech. 9:9 is “a colt, the foal of she-asses” (ʿayir ben-ʾaṯōnôṯ). ben-ʾaṯōnôṯ recalls ben ʾaṯōnô of Gen. 49:11. Only Mark (11:2) mentions Jesus’ command to “untie” the colt. Does this point back in any way to Gen. 49:11, he hitches [lit., binds] to the vine his ass? Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 662). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

13 The territory of Zebulon (Josh. 19:10–16) did not actually touch the coast of the Mediterranean, nor did it border on Sidon. But if Sidon is taken as a collective term for Phoenicia, then the statement is quite apt. The verse may suggest the penetration of the Zebulonites into the Plain of Acco, most likely under the patronage of Canaanite cities in the region (Judg. 1:30). More probably, the seashore here is the seashore of Chinnereth/Galilee. The reference to Sidon does not rule this out because “the W flank of the S Galilee highland, settled by the Zebulunites, actually borders on Phoenician territory in the Plain of Acco.”
I am inclined to read v. 13 not as a curse or judgment leveled at Zebulon because of his vain flirtation with maritime trafficking, but as a word of praise and promise addressed to the tribe. Zebulon will become a conqueror who will extend his territory to the west and to the north. This interpretation is substantiated with post-Joshua references like Judg. 1:30 and Judg. 4–5, especially 5:18, in which Zebulon is praised as one of the two most valiant participants in the fight which Deborah led against the Canaanites.
Zebulon is one of three Hebrew tribes (along with Dan and Asher) who are described as navigational. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 664). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

14-15 
One may interpret Jacob’s words to Issachar in two possible ways. The prevailing view is that Jacob paints Issachar as a group of people who put creaturely comforts (v. 15a-b) ahead of any other value, and as a result it cost them their independence (v. 15c–d). They became serfs to the local Canaanites, i.e., the feudal barons ruling in the Jezreel valley.
This sin is as old as Adam and Eve. The woman saw that the tree was good for food (rāʾá kî ṭôḇ), and the Issacharites saw a resting place that was good (rāʾá kî ṭôḇ). This theme surfaces again in the Sodom and Gomorrah stories, where pandering to lust became epidemic. It also appears in Jacob’s brother Esau. He put the needs of his stomach ahead of the voice of his conscience and paid for it dearly. The hersdmen of Lot (ch. 13) can identify with the choice of Issachar and his progeny.
The basic reason for this majority view is the last phrase of v. 15, wayehî lemas-ʿoḇēḏ (“he submitted to forced labor” [Westermann]; “and he became a willing serf” [Speiser]). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 667). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

This majority interpretation has sufficient problems to warrant an alternative interpretation of v. 15. For one thing, nowhere does the OT comment on the subjugation of the Issacharites to local power figures. The only possible evidence is extrabiblical (i.e., Amarna text no. 365), but even here this conclusion is only implied and possible. Moreover, when Judg. 1 lists the tribes that did not successfully drive out the local Canaanites (Manasseh, v. 27; Ephraim, v. 29; Zebulon, v. 30; Asher, v. 31; Naphtali, v. 33), some of which were contiguous with Issachar, it does not mention the tribal area of Issachar. Also, the Song of Deborah celebrates Issachar’s valued contribution in battle (Judg. 5:15). Finally, in Gen. 49, when Jacob clearly says a word of judgment on one of his sons, the reason for the father’s displeasure is explicit (Reuben, v. 4; Simeon and Levi, vv. 5–6). No such qualifying explanation is given with Issachar.
I have chosen to translate a laboring worker, a reading already reflected in LXX’s “and he became a farmer” (kaí egenḗthē anḗr geōrgós) Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 667–668). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

16-17
Verse 17 compares Dan to a serpent or viper who lunges at and bites the hooves of a passing horse, causing the horse to bolt and throw its rider. We have already run across serpent symbolism in Genesis. The first nāḥāš we encountered was in 3:1, 2, 4, 13, 14. The word hooves (lit., “heels,” ʿiqqeḇê) is familiar from the Jacob story. In his own way Jacob grabbed the heel of his uterine brother, just as this viper snaps at the heel of the horse. The imagery in 49:17 seems to suggest that Dan, although small, will be quite capable of holding his own. His strength will be greater than his size. As small as he is, he will be able to strike panic into an animal as large as a horse. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 670). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.


18  In the midst of his blessing on his sons Jacob says: For your saving action I wait, Yahweh. This statement sounds odd at this point in the poem. It reminds one of Jeremiah’s lament in Jer. 20:7–18. In between a charge against God plus a wish for vengeance on his enemies (vv. 7–12) and a curse on the day of his birth (vv. 14–18), we find this: “Sing to Yahweh; praise Yahweh; for he has delivered the life of the needy from the hand of evildoers” (v. 13)!
Freedman understands v. 18 as a liturgical element that breaks the sequence of blessings in the body of the poem. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 670–671). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Few consider the statement to be genuinely Jacob’s. But if it is, it is a ringing testimony by the elderly patriarch to his renewed faith in God that he shall one day be delivered by his God and experience eternal salvation. Interestingly, this is the only place in Genesis where any form of the root yšʿ is used. Although the illustrations of salvation and deliverance are scattered throughout Genesis, only here is the Hebrew word that most clearly means “salvation” used. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 671). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

19 
Settled east of the Jordan, Gad had to fight constantly against Ammonite and desert marauders, as is evident from the Jephthah story in Judges (11:1–12:7). In the Song of Deborah (Judg. 5:17) those of Gilead (Gad) are rebuked for remaining on their side of the Jordan (conceivably because they were preoccupied with their own problems at the time) and not coming to the assistance of tribes on the west side of the Jordan. In addition to pressure from the Ammonites, the Gadites also had to deal with the Moabites to the south. In the famous Moabite Stone from the mid-9th century b.c., Mesha, king of Moab, claims: “Now the men of Gad had always dwelt in the land of Ataroth, and the king of Israel had built Ataroth for them; but I fought against the town and took it and slew all the people of the town as satiation for Chemosh and Moab.” This oracle predicts Gad’s ability to bounce back, to retaliate against those who would seek his territory. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 672–673). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Gad is not big enough to engage in frontal warfare. He must attack from the rear (v. 19b). Mobility rather than number is Gad’s major asset. Vulnerable as the tribe was, especially from the east with the emergence of the kingdom of Ammon, Jacob’s words to Gad are prophetic. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 673). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

20
Asher is the blessed/happy tribe, evidenced by its agricultural bounty, to which v. 20 alludes. Asher occupies a fertile piece of land (the western slopes of the Galilean highland) and is therefore prosperous. Asher’s involvement in maritime enterprises (Judg. 5:17) also expanded that prosperity. The first line of the verse praises Asher for the exquisite quality of his culinary products. 1 K. 4:7 speaks of those who were responsible for providing food for Solomon and his household for one month each, and one may ask whether Gen. 49:20 reflects that custom. That is, the tribe of Asher out of its abudance fulfills its responsibility of sharing and providing the royal family with food necessities. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 674). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

One may understand the verse simply as Jacob’s prophecy that Asher and the Asherites will be blessed by God with abundance and prosperity, and will produce food luxuriant and rich enough for royalty. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 674). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

21
Naphtali, a tribe about which little is known, is praised in Judg. 4:6, 10; 5:18b for its yeoman cooperation with Deborah in her tribe’s fight with Canaanites. He was willing to abandon the safety of his own highlands in this hilly, wooded Galilean country in support of a vulnerable brother. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few areas of Canaan that show no signs of Canaanite occupation. This reference puts the tribe of Naphtali in a good light, and would suggest that Jacob’s word to Naphtali hints at the tribe’s abilities in fighting.
Other references give a different perspective on Naphtali. Thus the Naphtalites were unsuccessful in driving out the people of Beth-shemesh and Ben-anath (Judg. 1:33), although they do subject the indigenous people to forced labor. Earlier, the second census in Numbers (26:48–50) lists a decrease of 8,000 from the first census (Num. 1:42–43), 45,400 versus 53,400. Naphtali is one of five tribes (Reuben, 2,700; Simeon, 37,100; Gad, 5,150; Ephraim, 8,000) to show a decline.
As a result of the above data, it is difficult to be certain whether Jacob’s blessing on Naphtali is positive or negative. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 677). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

23  The enemies who attack Joseph may be understood as enemies of Joseph the individual or of Joseph the tribe. If the first, then the reference is to the brothers’ harsh treatment of Joseph. They certainly tried to make life bitter for Joseph. Note the use of śāṭam here (try to do him in) and in 50:15. What the brothers sought to do to Joseph (49:23) they feared he would do to them or feel about them (50:15). This verb (śāṭam) occurs but six times in the OT, and three of them involve Jacob in some way (27:41; 49:23; 50:15).
If Joseph the tribe is meant, then the reference is harder to determine. One possibility would be the intratribal war involving Ephraim and Benjamin (Judg. 19–21), less likely Ephraim and the men of Gilead (Judg. 12). Also possible is the Ephraimite occupation of Amalekite hill country in the time of the Judges (Judg. 12:15). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 684). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

24 A more faithful and simpler reading of the verse understands it as the thwarted and unsuccessful attempts of Joseph’s attackers to eliminate him; thus “break the bow” in v. 24 fits best the first sense given above, that of destroying military power. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 685). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

25  Names for deity continue with the God of your father and Shaddai. If my translation is correct, v. 24b-c described what Joseph’s Lord did to Joseph’s enemies. V. 25 begins to describe what Joseph’s Lord will do for Joseph. He will be both Joseph’s protector (v. 24) and his benefactor (vv. 25–26). The blessings ahead for Joseph include agricultural blessings (v. 25c–d) and family blessings (v. 25e). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 685). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

26  In conclusion Jacob prays that the blessing of the patriarchs may be upon Joseph. Actually, they are to be upon Joseph’s head, on the skull of the Nazir. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 685–686). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

27 Benjamin, Jacob’s last-born, receives Jacob’s last word of blessing. The animal metaphor chosen for Benjamin is not wide of the mark as an apt description of Benjamin’s descendants. He is pictured as a wolf who during the day consumes and divides with his lair the prey he has caught the night before. We saw in Gen. 46 that Benjamin has the most “little ones” to feed of Jacob’s children. The saying points primarily to a future day when the tribe of Benjamin shall become a predataor, engage in military raids, and realize booty from its victories. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 686–687). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

This characterization seems to be documented in the Benjamite judge Ehud (Judg. 3:15–30), and specifically his successful battle against the Transjordanian Moabites. Note also the description of the tribe of Benjamin in Judg. 20 and the tribe’s strength in that premonarchical civil war against other tribes. They were able, for a while at least, to hold their own, though vastly outnumbered (Judg. 20:14–21). Later Benjamites had the reputation of being “mighty warriors, bowmen” (1 Chr. 8:40; 12:2). It is not difficult to understand, therefore, why Israel’s first king should be drawn from the tribe of Benjamin, given its reputation for militancy (1 Sam. 9:1) Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 687). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

33  Jacob joins those who “breathed their last, and then were gathered to their kindred.” These formulae have been used already with Abraham (25:8), Ishmael (25:17), and with Isaac (35:29). Present with these three, but absent in the note about Jacob’s passing in 49:33, is the verb “died.” The emphasis is not on dying but on rejoining. He gathered his feet beside him (Qal of ʾāsap̄), then was gathered to his kin (Niphal of ʾāsap̄), after which Joseph (yôsēp̄) falls of the neck of his departed father (50:1). Hamilton, V. P. (1995).

As Jacob began to speak, note what happened: his words were not those of a regular conversation. He began to speak in a form of poetry and symbol: he actually began to predict the future of his sons, the future of the twelve tribes of Israel that were to descend from them. God, by His Spirit, enabled Jacob to predict the future of the nation Israel. Why? Why did God want the future of Israel predicted here?
⇒	To encourage Jacob. Jacob was dying, and he had been a great believer who had truly trusted the promises of God. God loved Jacob with a special love, and He wanted to give assurance to Jacob that his faith was not in vain. God wanted Jacob to know that his sons would grow into a great nation that would possess the promised land and bring forth Shiloh, the Savior of the world (see v. 10).
⇒	To warn the sons and their descendents of the weaknesses and traits in their nature. They needed to constantly guard against their weaknesses and strengthen themselves in the Lord.
⇒	To encourage Israel during their Egyptian bondage. Jacob’s prophecy would offer great hope to true believers during their enslavement in Egypt, for the prophecy predicted that they would someday be freed and possess the promised land.
⇒	To show people of all generations that we reap what we sow. God has and will continue to use Jacob’s prophecy to teach this awesome truth: we reap exactly what we have sown. This is clearly seen in Jacob’s sons: the blessing each received was based upon what he had sown upon earth. No doubt, God gave this prophecy to Jacob as a warning to all of us: we must guard against the judgment to come: we must be sure to sow a godly and righteous life upon earth.

3-4 Reuben
But note the prophecy: Reuben had proven weak and unstable; therefore, he would not excel, neither he nor his tribe (v. 4). Reuben had sinned: he had gone to bed with Bilhah, the servant of his mother (Ge. 35:22). He gave in to lust, to the desires of his flesh, gave in to his passions and urges. Reuben did not have the discipline to control himself. He lacked restraint. He proved incapable of giving leadership to all without abusing some. Therefore, God gave Jacob this prophetic declaration: Reuben would not excel as a tribe. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 389–390). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

But the descendents of Reuben failed to do this. The history of Israel shows that the tribe never did excel: the prophecy was proven to be precisely true.
⇒	Some of the tribe showed a lack of restraint and leadership when they joined in the rebellion of Korah against Moses (Nu. 16).
⇒	The tribe showed weakness and instability by refusing to fight when they were called to battle (Jud. 5:15f).
⇒	The tribe showed a lack of restraint by being the first to request a place to settle in the promised land. They did not cross the Jordan River with the other tribes but prematurely settled on the east side of the river. The east was far less valuable than the west side (Nu. 32).
⇒	The tribe showed a lack of godly discipline by helping to erect a false place of worship (Jos. 22:10–34).
⇒	The tribe was never important in the history of Israel and never produced a leader of any stature whatsoever for the nation.
Thought 1. Immorality reveals a character flaw within a person. It shows lack of discipline, control, and restraint. It shows the willingness to hurt and cause pain to people, an inability to lead everyone equally. If we sow immorality, we shall reap the judgment of God. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 390). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
5-7 Simeon and Levi
a. The sin of these two brothers was anger, cruelty, and vengeance. They had taken vengeance upon the city of Shechem because the prince had raped their sister, Dinah (Ge. 34:1f). They killed all the males and plundered the city, enslaving the women and children.
b. Note what Jacob said about their behavior: it was inexcusable. He strongly disapproved of what they had done (v. 6).
c. Jacob also made a very special pronouncement upon their anger: their anger was to be cursed, for it was cruel and fierce (v. 7). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 390). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

1)	Note that the prophecy happened to the tribe of Simeon just as Jacob had predicted.
⇒	The tribe of Simeon was not given a separate region within the promised land. It was only given land within the midst of Judah’s territory; therefore, Simeon was not allowed to stand alone. The tribe was always controlled by Judah, the strongest tribe of Israel (Jos. 19:1; Jud. 1:3).
⇒	The tribe was entirely passed over at the end of Moses’ life. When he was blessing the tribes, he never mentioned Simeon. The tribe had been completely absorbed by Judah (De. 33).
However, some Simeon descendents did seek pasture for their flocks outside Canaan, conquered some land and settled there permanently (1 Chr. 4:38–43). But note: this was outside the promised land.
2)	Levi was also judged to be scattered. His tribe was dispersed as priests throughout the land (Jos. 21:1–40). The priests never owned any territory, but they were given homes in forty-eight Levitical cities scattered all over the promised land. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).

8-12 Judah
Consequently, Jacob, under God’s prophetic utterance, passed the birthright not to one son, but to two sons, to both Judah and Joseph. Scripture clearly states this:
“Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright [double portion of the estate] was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright. For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph’s)” (1 Chr. 5:1–2). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 391). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Judah’s life is a beautiful picture of a person’s growing into spiritual maturity. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 391). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

 The change in his heart and life is seen in three events:
⇒	Before his father, he offered himself as surety for Benjamin (see note—Ge. 43:8–10).
⇒	Before Joseph, he pleaded and offered his life in the place of Benjamin.
⇒	Before the land of Egypt, he was acknowledged as the leader by his father (see note—Ge. 46:28–30).
It was because of Judah’s clear repentance and conversion as well as the strong leadership he gave to the family that he was chosen to be the leader of the family. Note the prophetic blessing pronounced upon him and his tribe.
a. Judah’s tribe was to be praised for military leadership and power (vv. 8–9). His hand would be on the neck of his enemies: he would defeat them, and the other tribes would bow down before him, that is, would follow his leadership in battle.
Judah would be like a lion. The lion is a symbol of courage, strength, and security. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 391). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. Note these facts about Jesus Christ, the promised seed, the Messiah and Savior of the world.
(1)	The New Testament identifies Jesus Christ with this prophecy. Jesus Christ is “the Lion of the tribe of Judah.”
“And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof” (Re. 5:5). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 392). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

13 Zebulun
Thought 1. This was the only tribe that had its territory spelled out in Jacob’s prophetic blessing. This suggests that Zebulun was to be blessed with a special territory, an area well located for trade and wealth. God was also to bless the tribe of Zebulun with a unique opportunity to serve the other tribes by providing goods for them.
The lesson is clear: God is the source of our blessings. It is He who has set the laws of nature in place, the laws that give us rain, sunshine, seed, growth, and harvest. It is God who has given us life, health, and the ability to work and produce and to know purpose and fulfillment. All that we have is due to God. We must, therefore, serve Him, using our blessings wisely. We must do what Zebulun was to do: use what we have to serve and help those who are around us. We must become a center of service, a center for helping all those who surround us. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 393). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

14-15 Issachar
The idea is that the tribe of Issachar was to be a strong and sturdy tribe of people. The prophecy, of course, proved true.
⇒	The tribe rose up and courageously fought for Deborah and Barak when other tribes refused to help (Jud. 5:15–18).
⇒	The tribe was to grow and provide 87,000 men for the military during the rule of Israel’s kings (1 Chr. 7:5).
However, Issachar had one trait that proved to be a terrible weakness, a trait that its people needed to guard against: that of lethargy and complacency (v. 15). There was the danger that the tribe’s primary objective in life would become comfort, ease, prosperity, and rest. In fact, note what the prophecy predicted: the people would become so comfortable and satisfied that they would be more willing to be enslaved than to risk the comforts of life (v. 15).
Thought 1. Complacency, lethargy, comfort, and being at ease are enemies of our souls. They destroy ambition, drive, initiative, production, work, even life itself. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 393–394). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

16-17
Dan: there was the prophecy concerning Da. The tribe was to produce capable rulers. The name Dan means to judge or to administer justice. The thought is that the judges of Dan would rule their tribe well. The most well-known judge of Dan was Samson (Jud. 13–16).
The second prophecy concerning Dan was that the tribe was to be just like a snake, be a deadly opponent for its enemies. Samson is again the most well-known leader of Dan who single-handedly defeated the foes of Israel. H.C. Leupold suggests that Jacob may be giving a warning by comparing Dan to a serpent: that the tribe must always be on guard against treachery, double-dealing, and dishonesty.
This, in fact, was to prove true. Dan was the first tribe to take up idol worship in Israel, the first to be dishonest and pull a double deal against God. They proved to be a treacherous and double-dealing people toward God. Some commentators suggest this could be the reason why the tribe of Dan is omitted from the numbering of the 144,000 saints in Re. 7:5–8 and from the tribes listed in 1 Chr. 1–7. However, there is no Scriptural evidence that this is the reason for their omission in the two lists. The tribe is listed in more than sixteen other chronologies of the Bible.
Thought 1. God warns us against idolatry, against putting the things of this world before Him. Idols include …
•	the gods and false religions of this world
•	the people whom we put before God, whom we idolize and give our allegiance
•	the possessions, property, positions, and pleasures that consume our lives and leave no room for the worship and service of the true God of heaven and earth Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 394). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

19 Gad
Gad—Guidance: there was the prophecy concerning Gad. This tribe was to be surrounded by the nomadic tribes of the Midianites, Ammonites, and Arabians—roving marauders from the desert. But Gad was to be a tribe who would be successful in struggling against his enemy. The idea is that he would never give up no matter the strength of his enemy. He would struggle and fight until at last he overcame. Therefore, he would know the glory of victory (see 1 Chr. 5:18; 12:8) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 395). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

20 Asher
Asher apparently became an indulgent tribe of people, given over to the wealth and luxury they enjoyed. The name Asher means happy, lucky, or fortunate. They inherited some of the best land, but during the days of the judges, the people were swallowed up by the luxury of wealth. They just refused to help the other tribes in fighting against the enemies of Israel. They were too caught up in the worldly pleasures, bright lights, and comforts of this earth to worry about the needs of brothers under attack on some far away border (Jud. 5:17–18).
Thought 1. Scripture warns against worldliness, against becoming too attached to the luxury, pleasures, bright lights, and greed of this earth. True believers are to live separated lives, lives that are different—drastically different—from the worldly of this earth. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 396). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

22-26 Joseph
d. But Joseph will not only be strengthened against his enemies; he will be richly blessed with three things:
⇒	with the blessings of heavenly rain and fertile soil (v. 25b).
⇒	with the blessings of springs and streams (v. 25b).
⇒	with the blessings of many offspring or descendents (v. 25c).
e. But even that is not all: Joseph was to be blessed above all his brothers (v. 26). Jacob declared that he had been blessed above his own fathers, Abraham and Isaac. Therefore Joseph, as the recipient of the birthright, was to be blessed above all his brothers. Jacob actually called out for his own great blessings to rest upon the head of Joseph, for the great blessings he had known to be experienced by Joseph.
Thought 1. The blessings that God pours out upon His true follower are unlimited. To stir thought, just a few are listed here. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 398). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

            <Text>Jacob Blesses His Sons
49 Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall happen to you in days to come. 
	2 	“Assemble and listen, O sons of Jacob, 
listen to Israel your father. 

Summarize what chap. 49 is about. (Think: Do Jacob’s statements relate to his sons or to their descendants? Proof? Note v28.)

The chapter is about Jacob pronouncing blessings on his sons
What he is about to share with them is in the form of an inspired prophecy about the destiny of each son as extended into the tribe emanating from that son.
God, by His Spirit, enabled Jacob to predict the future of the nation Israel. Why? Why did God want the future of Israel predicted here?
⇒	To encourage Jacob. Jacob was dying, and he had been a great believer who had truly trusted the promises of God. God loved Jacob with a special love, and He wanted to give assurance to Jacob that his faith was not in vain. God wanted Jacob to know that his sons would grow into a great nation that would possess the promised land and bring forth Shiloh, the Savior of the world (see v. 10).
⇒	To warn the sons and their descendents of the weaknesses and traits in their nature. They needed to constantly guard against their weaknesses and strengthen themselves in the Lord.
⇒	To encourage Israel during their Egyptian bondage. Jacob’s prophecy would offer great hope to true believers during their enslavement in Egypt, for the prophecy predicted that they would someday be freed and possess the promised land.
⇒	To show people of all generations that we reap what we sow. God has and will continue to use Jacob’s prophecy to teach this awesome truth: we reap exactly what we have sown. This is clearly seen in Jacob’s sons: the blessing each received was based upon what he had sown upon earth. No doubt, God gave this prophecy to Jacob as a warning to all of us: we must guard against the judgment to come: we must be sure to sow a godly and righteous life upon earth.

	3 	“Reuben, you are my firstborn, 
my might, and the first-fruits of my strength, 
preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. 
	4 	Unstable as water, you shall not have preeminence, 
because you went up to your father’s bed; 
then you defiled it—he went up to my couch! 

 What did Jacob say regarding Reuben? What event is referred to here? (Think: Where else have men pronounced blessings on their sons?)

That although he was preeminent in dignity and in power, who would not have the preeminence because he defiled Jacob’s bed.
The saying directed to Reuben has two parts. 
The first is a word about privilege. Reuben is Jacob’s firstborn, once a source of inestimable joy to his father. 
The second is a word about accountability. Because Reuben slept with Jacob’s concubine (35:22), he forfeits all the privileges that go with primogeniture. 
Reuben had proven weak and unstable; therefore, he would not excel, neither he nor his tribe (v. 4). 
Reuben had sinned: he had gone to bed with Bilhah, the servant of his mother (Ge. 35:22). 
He gave in to lust, to the desires of his flesh, gave in to his passions and urges. Reuben did not have the discipline to control himself. He lacked restraint. 
He proved incapable of giving leadership to all without abusing some. Therefore, God gave Jacob this prophetic declaration: Reuben would not excel as a tribe. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 389–390). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
From this first oracle the teaching is clear that the behavior of one individual affects the destiny of his descendants. God does visit the iniquities of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who live licentiously, as did Reuben (Exod. 20:5). 
This promise works in a positive direction as well. Recall God’s words to Abraham, “And by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice” (22:18); or God’s words to Isaac, “I will multiply your descendants … because Abraham obeyed my voice” (26:4–5).

It shows the willingness to hurt and cause pain to people, an inability to lead everyone equally. If we sow immorality, we shall reap the judgment of God. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).

	5 	“Simeon and Levi are brothers; 
weapons of violence are their swords. 
	6 	Let my soul come not into their council; 
O my glory, be not joined to their company. 
		For in their anger they killed men, 
and in their willfulness they hamstrung oxen. 
	7 	Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce, 
and their wrath, for it is cruel! 
		I will divide them in Jacob 
and scatter them in Israel. 

What had Simeon and Levi done? What did Jacob say about it?

Simeon and Levi were violent men who killed other men in their anger
In his words addressed to Simeon and Levi, Jacob recalls a previous incident in which they were involved, as he did with Reuben. 
The antecedent for Jacob’s rebuke against sons two and three is obviously the incident recorded in Gen. 34, Simeon’s and Levi’s massacre of the male population of Shechem in retaliation for the humiliation of their sister Dinah. 
Here is another illustration, as in the Reuben oracle, of the principle that the behavior of one generation affects the circumstances of later generations.

1)	Note that the prophecy happened to the tribe of Simeon just as Jacob had predicted.
⇒	The tribe of Simeon was not given a separate region within the promised land. It was only given land within the midst of Judah’s territory; therefore, Simeon was not allowed to stand alone. The tribe was always controlled by Judah, the strongest tribe of Israel (Jos. 19:1; Jud. 1:3).

⇒	The tribe was entirely passed over at the end of Moses’ life. When he was blessing the tribes, he never mentioned Simeon. The tribe had been completely absorbed by Judah (De. 33).
⇒ However, some Simeon descendents did seek pasture for their flocks outside Canaan, conquered some land and settled there permanently (1 Chr. 4:38–43). But note: this was outside the promised land.

 Describe Jacob’s prophecy about Judah. Compare it to previous sons.

Judah’s life is a beautiful picture of a person’s growing into spiritual maturity. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 391). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

 The change in his heart and life is seen in three events:
⇒	Before his father, he offered himself as surety for Benjamin (see note—Ge. 43:8–10).
⇒	Before Joseph, he pleaded and offered his life in the place of Benjamin.
⇒	Before the land of Egypt, he was acknowledged as the leader by his father (see note—Ge. 46:28–30).
It was because of Judah’s clear repentance and conversion as well as the strong leadership he gave to the family that he was chosen to be the leader of the family. Note the prophetic blessing pronounced upon him and his tribe

In the first verse of the oracle Judah is given a more honorable position than his brothers by his brothers. They praise Judah (note the play on sound here—yehûḏá yôḏûḵā) and bow before him. 

5. Special Assignment: What does v10 show about the tribe of Judah? (Think: Who/what is Shiloh?)

The tribe of Judah shall rule over the others

There are, then, four major approaches to Gen. 49:10c: 
(1) attempt to make sense of MT by retaining “Shiloh”; 
(2) follow the reading of the ancient versions (“that which is his”); 
(3) emend šîlōh to šay lōh (“tribute to him”); 
(4) discover in “Shiloh” some Semitic word meaning “ruler” or “prince.” Of course, many other interpretations have been suggested, including those who see Judah’s son Shelah in Shiloh, and those who resort to yet other redivisioning of the consonants. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 661). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

scepter. This is a symbol of eminence and kingship (see Num. 24:17).

not depart. The prophecy is confirmed by the Davidic covenant (2 Sam. 7:16).

donkey. This was the ride of a chief in the period of the judges (Judg. 10:4; 12:14; cf. Zech. 9:9).
vine. The vine is a symbol of fertility, joy, peace, and prosperity. Here it is a hyperbole of tremendous prosperity

wash his garments in wine. This is another image of incredible prosperity and/or power. If the former, the incomplete metaphor may signify that wine will be so plentiful and common that it can be used for scrub water.

The New Testament identifies Jesus Christ with this prophecy. Jesus Christ is “the Lion of the tribe of Judah.”
“And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof” (Re. 5:5).

	13 	“Zebulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea; 
he shall become a haven for ships, 
and his border shall be at Sidon. 

13 The territory of Zebulon (Josh. 19:10–16) did not actually touch the coast of the Mediterranean, nor did it border on Sidon. 
But if Sidon is taken as a collective term for Phoenicia, then the statement is quite apt. 
The verse may suggest the penetration of the Zebulonites into the Plain of Acco, most likely under the patronage of Canaanite cities in the region (Judg. 1:30). 
More probably, the seashore here is the seashore of Chinnereth/Galilee. 
The reference to Sidon does not rule this out because “the W flank of the S Galilee highland, settled by the Zebulunites, actually borders on Phoenician territory in the Plain of Acco.”

Thought 1. This was the only tribe that had its territory spelled out in Jacob’s prophetic blessing. This suggests that Zebulun was to be blessed with a special territory, an area well located for trade and wealth. God was also to bless the tribe of Zebulun with a unique opportunity to serve the other tribes by providing goods for them.
The lesson is clear: God is the source of our blessings. It is He who has set the laws of nature in place, the laws that give us rain, sunshine, seed, growth, and harvest. 
It is God who has given us life, health, and the ability to work and produce and to know purpose and fulfillment. All that we have is due to God. 
We must, therefore, serve Him, using our blessings wisely. We must do what Zebulun was to do: use what we have to serve and help those who are around us. We must become a center of service, a center for helping all those who surround us. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 393).

	14 	“Issachar is a strong donkey, 
crouching between the sheepfolds. 
	15 	He saw that a resting place was good, 
and that the land was pleasant, 
		so he bowed his shoulder to bear, 
and became a servant at forced labor. 

One may interpret Jacob’s words to Issachar in two possible ways. The prevailing view is that Jacob paints Issachar as a group of people who put creaturely comforts (v. 15a-b) ahead of any other value, and as a result it cost them their independence (v. 15c–d). They became serfs to the local Canaanites, i.e., the feudal barons ruling in the Jezreel valley.
 Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 667). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
However, Issachar had one trait that proved to be a terrible weakness, a trait that its people needed to guard against: that of lethargy and complacency (v. 15). There was the danger that the tribe’s primary objective in life would become comfort, ease, prosperity, and rest. In fact, note what the prophecy predicted: the people would become so comfortable and satisfied that they would be more willing to be enslaved than to risk the comforts of life (v. 15).

I have chosen to translate a laboring worker, a reading already reflected in LXX’s “and he became a farmer” (kaí egenḗthē anḗr geōrgós) Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 667–668). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.
For one thing, nowhere does the OT comment on the subjugation of the Issacharites to local power figures. The only possible evidence is extrabiblical (i.e., Amarna text no. 365), but even here this conclusion is only implied and possible. 
Moreover, when Judg. 1 lists the tribes that did not successfully drive out the local Canaanites (Manasseh, v. 27; Ephraim, v. 29; Zebulon, v. 30; Asher, v. 31; Naphtali, v. 33), some of which were contiguous with Issachar, it does not mention the tribal area of Issachar. 
Also, the Song of Deborah celebrates Issachar’s valued contribution in battle (Judg. 5:15). 
Finally, in Gen. 49, when Jacob clearly says a word of judgment on one of his sons, the reason for the father’s displeasure is explicit (Reuben, v. 4; Simeon and Levi, vv. 5–6). No such qualifying explanation is given with Issachar.
	16 	“Dan shall judge his people 
as one of the tribes of Israel. 
	17 	Dan shall be a serpent in the way, 
a viper by the path, 
		that bites the horse’s heels 
so that his rider falls backward. 

Verse 17 compares Dan to a serpent or viper who lunges at and bites the hooves of a passing horse, causing the horse to bolt and throw its rider. We have already run across serpent symbolism in Genesis. 

The imagery in 49:17 seems to suggest that Dan, although small, will be quite capable of holding his own. His strength will be greater than his size. As small as he is, he will be able to strike panic into an animal as large as a horse. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 670). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.


	18 	I wait for your salvation, O Lord. 

Few consider the statement to be genuinely Jacob’s. But if it is, it is a ringing testimony by the elderly patriarch to his renewed faith in God that he shall one day be delivered by his God and experience eternal salvation.


	19 	“Raiders shall raid Gad, 
but he shall raid at their heels. 

Gad—Guidance: there was the prophecy concerning Gad. 
This tribe was to be surrounded by the nomadic tribes of the Midianites, Ammonites, and Arabians—roving marauders from the desert. 
But Gad was to be a tribe who would be successful in struggling against his enemy. 
The idea is that he would never give up no matter the strength of his enemy. He would struggle and fight until at last he overcame. Therefore, he would know the glory of victory (see 1 Chr. 5:18; 12:8) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 395). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
In the famous Moabite Stone from the mid-9th century b.c., Mesha, king of Moab, claims: 
“Now the men of Gad had always dwelt in the land of Ataroth, and the king of Israel had built Ataroth for them; but I fought against the town and took it and slew all the people of the town as satiation for Chemosh and Moab.” 
This oracle predicts Gad’s ability to bounce back, to retaliate against those who would seek his territory. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 672–673). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.


	20 	“Asher’s food shall be rich, 
and he shall yield royal delicacies. 

Asher is the blessed/happy tribe, evidenced by its agricultural bounty, to which v. 20 alludes. 
food will be rich. This is a reference to its fertile land
Asher occupies a fertile piece of land (the western slopes of the Galilean highland) and is therefore prosperous. Asher’s involvement in maritime enterprises (Judg. 5:17) also expanded that prosperity. 
The first line of the verse praises Asher for the exquisite quality of his culinary products. 
1 K. 4:7 speaks of those who were responsible for providing food for Solomon and his household for one month each, and one may ask whether Gen. 49:20 reflects that custom. 
That is, the tribe of Asher out of its abudance fulfills its responsibility of sharing and providing the royal family with food necessities. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 674). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

One may understand the verse simply as Jacob’s prophecy that Asher and the Asherites will be blessed by God with abundance and prosperity, and will produce food luxuriant and rich enough for royalty.

	21 	“Naphtali is a doe let loose

Naphtali, a tribe about which little is known, is praised in Judg. 4:6, 10; 5:18b for its yeoman cooperation with Deborah in her tribe’s fight with Canaanites.

In a chiastic pattern, the poem exclaims that his fertility (49:22) and his safety (49:23–24) are due to God, who protects him (49:24) and blesses him with the fertility of the soil and of the body (49:25). The comprehensive blessings of his father(s) (49:26) rest upon Joseph above his brothers.

of the ancient mountains, than. The niv text note offers the option “Your father’s blessings are greater than the blessings of my progenitors, as great as the bounty of the age-old hills.” The Hebrew text can mean either. G. Rendsburg thinks that the pun is deliberate.

Joseph will not only be strengthened against his enemies; he will be richly blessed with three things:
⇒	with the blessings of heavenly rain and fertile soil (v. 25b).
⇒	with the blessings of springs and streams (v. 25b).
⇒	with the blessings of many offspring or descendents (v. 25c).
But even that is not all: Joseph was to be blessed above all his brothers (v. 26). Jacob declared that he had been blessed above his own fathers, Abraham and Isaac. Therefore Joseph, as the recipient of the birthright, was to be blessed above all his brothers. Jacob actually called out for his own great blessings to rest upon the head of Joseph, for the great blessings he had known to be experienced by Joseph.
Thought 1. The blessings that God pours out upon His true follower are unlimited. To stir thought, just a few are listed here. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 398). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


	27 	“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, 
in the morning devouring the prey 
and at evening dividing the spoil.” 

27 Benjamin, Jacob’s last-born, receives Jacob’s last word of blessing.  
He is pictured as a wolf who during the day consumes and divides with his lair the prey he has caught the night before. 
The saying points primarily to a future day when the tribe of Benjamin shall become a predataor, engage in military raids, and realize booty from its victories. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 686–687). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Jacob’s Death and Burial
28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel. This is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him. 29 Then he commanded them and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30 in the cave that is in the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. 31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife. There they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah— 32 the field and the cave that is in it were bought from the Hittites.” 33 When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed and breathed his last and was gathered to his people.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ge 49:1–33). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.

33  Jacob joins those who “breathed their last, and then were gathered to their kindred.” 
These formulae have been used already with Abraham (25:8), Ishmael (25:17), and with Isaac (35:29). 
Present with these three, but absent in the note about Jacob’s passing in 49:33, is the verb “died.” 
The emphasis is not on dying but on rejoining. He gathered his feet beside him (Qal of ʾāsap̄), then was gathered to his kin (Niphal of ʾāsap̄), after which Joseph (yôsēp̄) falls of the neck of his departed father (50:1). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 689). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

Sovereignty and Covenant
These prophetic statements at the end of the patriarchal era exhibit God’s sovereignty over the nations. He blesses the tribes but not independently from their character. The prophecies are based on praise or blame of the fathers.

Blessing
The family’s future includes trouble as well as prosperity: “scattering, violence, violation, and turmoil follow the family as well as blessing and power.”

Saving Grace

Jacob censures Levi for his past cruelty. Later, God will redeem that ferocity for good (cf. Deut. 33:8–11). 
In Ex. 32:25–29 the Levites rally around Moses and kill their idolatrous and fornicating brothers. In Num. 25:7–14 Phinehas, a Levite, kills a fornicating Simeonite. 
For these acts the tribe of Levi is set apart to the Lord and given the coveted priesthood. 
The Levites serve as fierce guards around the sanctuary and execute an encroacher on the temple’s terra sancta (cf. Num. 1:51b). Sinners had to reckon with this tribe.

Messianism 

In spite of the difficulties in the interpretation of šîlōh in 49:10, all interpreters agree that Jacob’s blessing granting the tribe of Judah eternal kingship over the nations pertains to David and the Davidic covenant (see “Fourth Motif: The Ruler” in the introduction).
In sum, in the Old Testament the prophetic blessing on Judah is fulfilled in David and his house, and in the New Testament it is interpreted as being fulfilled and consummated in Jesus Christ (see Ezek. 21:27; Rev. 5:5). 
Jesus Christ—“Christ” is the Greek equivalent of Hebrew “Messiah”—may have signified his fulfillment by changing water into wine as his first miracle (cf. Gen. 49:11–12 and John 2:1–11). 
In the Apocalypse, John sees the prophecy consummated when “the Lion of the tribe of Judah” executes judgment upon all the nations (Rev 5:5).</Text>

            <Text>50 Then Joseph fell on his father’s face and wept over him and kissed him. 2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel. 3 Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days. 
4 And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 5 ‘My father made me swear, saying, “I am about to die: in my tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.” Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return.’ ” 6 And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.” 7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 8 as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen. 9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company. 10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation, and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan. 12 Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them, 13 for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. 14 After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father. 
God’s Good Purposes
15 When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.” 16 So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died: 17 ‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.” ’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 18 His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” 19 But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for am I in the place of God? 20 As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. 21 So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them. 
The Death of Joseph
22 So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father’s house. Joseph lived 110 years. 23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were counted as Joseph’s own. 24 And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” 25 Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” 26 So Joseph died, being 110 years old. They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ge 50). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.

So the physicians embalmed Israel. 3 Forty days were required for it, for that is how many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days. 

What did the physicians do with Jacob’s body? How long did it take? How long did the Egyptians mourn for him?

the physicians embalmed Israel
It took the embalmers forty days (a frequently used biblical number) to complete their work. Interestingly, the Egyptians mourned him for seventy days. More than likely this is not seventy more days after the completion of the embalming. Rather, the period of mourning extends beyond the embalming process by thirty days.

the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.
the Egyptians mourned. Not surprisingly, the whole nation mourns the father of their Hebrew savior (see 47:25)
seventy days. They were the days of mourning for an Egyptian king.


4 And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 5 ‘My father made me swear, saying, “I am about to die: in my tomb that I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.” Now therefore, let me please go up and bury my father. Then I will return.’ ” 6 And Pharaoh answered, “Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear.” 7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 8 as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen. 9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen. It was a very great company. 

What request did Joseph then make? Why?

He asked Pharaoh to let him bury Jacob in Canaan 
Because this was Jacob's request 

Who went with Joseph? Who/what did not go? (Think: What is indicated by the fact all these people went?)

With him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father’s household
Three different groups participate in Jacob’s funeral procession: (1) high-ranking members of Pharaoh’s bureaucracy, v. 7; (2) male survivors of Jacob’s family, v. 8 (what of Leah and his concubines—are they still living?); (3) a military escort, v. 9.
Only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.




10 When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and grievous lamentation, and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 11 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan. 12 Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them, 13 for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place. 14 After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father. 

 Where did they stop and why (v10)? How did this affect the Canaanites?

They stopped at the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan to lament and mourn for seven days 
Atad. The sixth century a.d. Madeba mosaic map locates an Alon Atad (terebinth of Atad) near Beth Agla (Beth Hogla—modern Deir Hajlah) between Jericho and the Dead Sea. Is Jacob in his death showing his descendants the road to the Promised Land?
Seven days was the normal period for mourning (see 1 Sam. 31:13 par. 1 Chr. 10:12; 2 Sam. 11:27; Job 2:13; Jdt. 16:24; Sir. 10:12)
The Canaanites said, “This is a grievous mourning by the Egyptians.”

What name was given to this place, and what does the name mean?

The place was named Abel-mizraim. It means “mourning of Egypt”
Upon seeing this ritual, the residents state: How grievously the Egyptians are mourning! Moved by this scene, they rename the vicinity Abelmizraim, thus providing another instance of etiological narrative in Genesis.

What did Jacob’s sons do with Jacob’s body? What promise did this fulfill?

They buried him in the cave of the field at Machpelah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place
The sons carry out their father’s last wish. They bury him in the cave of Machpelah where Jacob’s father, and grandfather, and one of his wives (Leah) are buried. 
Thus Jacob leaves one part of his family and joins another part of his family. Perhaps the recall of Abraham’s purchase of this real estate from Ephron the Hittite (see Gen. 23) is prompted by the use of the word ʾaḥuzzá (“burial site”)

God’s Good Purposes
15 When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil that we did to him.” 16 So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died: 17 ‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.” ’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 18 His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.” 19 But Joseph said to them, “Do not fear, for am I in the place of God? 20 As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today. 21 So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones.” Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them. 

What concern did Joseph’s brothers then have, and what did they do about it?

They were afraid that Joseph would exact revenge 
They sent a message to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died: ‘Say to Joseph, “Please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.” ’ And now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.”
His brothers also came and fell down before him and said, “Behold, we are your servants.”

How did Joseph respond to his brothers? How did he say he would treat them? (Think: Review what this teaches about forgiveness and God’s providence.)

But note Joseph’s response: he would not accept their offer to be his servants. He would keep his forgiving spirit. 
He had forgiven his brothers years before, over seventeen years earlier. 
He had never gone back on his promise of forgiveness (vv. 19–21). Joseph had truly forgiven. This meant that he had asked God to give him God’s very own spirit of forgiveness. 
What is God’s spirit of forgiveness?
⇒ Once forgiven, always forgiven.
There is no other forgiveness, not true forgiveness. True forgiveness does just that: it forgives once and for all. The old sin or wrong is never brought up again. It cannot be, not if it has been truly forgiven.

Of course, this is difficult to accept, especially if we are the guilty party upon whom vengeance can fall. 
This was the problem the brothers were having. They were not sure that Joseph had truly forgiven them. 
But Joseph wanted to assure them: he had forgiven them, and he had kept on forgiving them. He could do nothing less, for he was following God to the end. 
And God demands that we forgive, forgive once and for all. Note how Joseph sought to convince his brothers of his forgiveness.

Why was Joseph able to forgive?

God’s place to judge, not his. He was, therefore, leaving the judgment up to God.
God overrules man’s evil and uses it for good

20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.

Joseph declared that God had overruled their evil and worked it out for good (v. 20). This was the same declaration Joseph had made to his brothers seventeen years earlier. 
He had seen God’s hand taking all the terrible circumstances of his life and working them out for good. God had used all the terrible trials to strengthen him and to teach him to endure and to work hard. 
Thus God was able to exalt Joseph to be the ruler of Egypt so that he could save the world of his day from utter catastrophe. 
God had used Joseph to save the world, but especially His people, Israel, the believers of the earth; to save them from total economic collapse and starvation due to the seven-year famine that had struck the known world of that day.

One must repay evil with good: He promised to take care of his brothers &amp; assured them

Joseph declared that he must repay evil with good (v. 21). He must do exactly what Scripture says we must do:
“Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good” (Ro. 12:21).
Joseph encouraged his brothers not to fear: he was going to provide for them and their families. 
Note how he did all he could to reassure his brothers. He spoke only kind and comforting words to them (v. 21﻿b).

Thought 1. What a dynamic example of forgiving others! If Joseph could forgive his brothers, we can forgive any person for anything. No matter how terrible the wrong or evil done against us, we can forgive the person. In fact, we must. God demands that we forgive them.


The Death of Joseph
22 So Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father’s house. Joseph lived 110 years. 23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation. The children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were counted as Joseph’s own. 24 And Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will visit you and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.” 25 Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here.” 26 So Joseph died, being 110 years old. They embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ge 50). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.

What are we told about the rest of Joseph’s life (vv 22,23)?

Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father’s house. 
Joseph lived 110 years. 
Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation.

23 Makir. This is the most important clan of Manasseh, even identified with the whole tribe. The name, which means “one who is sold,” is probably a word play with the life of Joseph.

24. to his brothers. The word may mean “relatives.” If it means “brothers” in the strict sense, then some or all of his older brothers outlive him.

take you up out of this land. This is a technical phrase for the Exodus from Egypt (see Gen. 15:13–14). Joseph speaks as a prophet, perhaps informed by God’s promise to Abraham.

Joseph hung on to the great promises of God even as he faced death. we hang on to the great promises of God, never letting go. 

Joseph declared the deliverance of Israel from Egypt; that they would inherit the promised land

the land he swore/promised. The theme of the patriarchs is on Joseph’s lips at death. The land is a divine gift to the elect family.

Joseph declared that God was going to deliver Israel out of Egypt and take them back to the promised land (v. 24﻿b). 
Imagine, Joseph had been living out of the promised land for over 90 years. Yet, here he was declaring his faith in the great promises of God. 
This possibly could be considered a prophecy by Joseph, but more likely it is just a strong declaration of his faith.

Now, note what Joseph did. It was very significant, so significant that Joseph demanded an oath from his brothers. 
He made them swear that they would carry his bones back to the promised land when they returned (v. 25). 
This was one of the greatest declarations of faith in the promises of God ever made by a person. Remember: it was to be four hundred years before Joseph’s bones could be buried in Canaan

By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones” (He. 11:22).

The request of Joseph was to be fulfilled. Israel took his bones with them when they returned to the promised land. Moses himself took the bones of Joseph out of Egypt (Ex. 13:19), and some years later his bones were buried at Shechem, buried in a tract of land that Jacob had bought (Jos. 24:32).</Text>

embalm. See also 50:26. Egyptians embalmed the honored dead to assist the afterlife journey. The Israelites did not embalm bodies, since they did not hold that conviction. Rather, they insisted that a corpse be handled properly because it was important especially for the living that the deceased rested peacefully in the grave until their resurrection (see Theological Reflections below). Joseph embalms his father to give him dignity and to prepare his corpse to make the extended journey to the Promised Land, the hope of Israel.

seventy days. They were the days of mourning for an Egyptian king.

All.… The narrator underscores the grand size of the funeral cortège. The Egyptian funeral retinue includes Joseph, the leading Egyptian officials, all the senior dignitaries from Pharaoh’s court and the empire (50:7), and an army of chariots and charioteers. Accompanying them are all of Joseph’s household and of Jacob’s household (50:8), except the children and animals. The funeral procession occurs in two stages: the great cortège proceeds to Atad, and there they stop for seven days of mourning.

dignitaries. The Hebrew is literally “senior officials.”

Atad. The sixth century a.d. Madeba mosaic map locates an Alon Atad (terebinth of Atad) near Beth Agla (Beth Hogla—modern Deir Hajlah) between Jericho and the Dead Sea. Is Jacob in his death showing his descendants the road to the Promised Land?

a seven-day period of mourning. This is in addition to the royal mourning in Egypt. Seven days, a full cycle of days, is the usual period of time to express great grief in Israel and in the ancient Near East (cf. 1 Sam. 31:13; Job 2:13; Ezek. 3:15). It is already attested in the Gilgamesh Epic. It may express the rite of passage, like seven days from birth to circumcision (Gen. 17:12), the rite of marriage (29:27), or the rite of consecration to priesthood (Lev. 8:33).

Abel Mizraim. The name involves a pun. Hebrew ʾēḇel means “mourning,” and ʾāḇēl means “brook,” but only as the first part of a Canaanite place name (e.g., 2 Sam. 20:14, 15; Judg. 11:33; 2 Chron. 16:4). Hence the name means “brook of Egypt,” a play with “mourning of Egypt.”

15. saw that their father was dead. Realizing their vulnerability before their powerful brother without the restraining authority of their father before whom he bows, they act in fear of Joseph, not in faith. They are not yet rid of their guilt, in spite of Joseph’s earlier assurances (45:1–15).

holds a grudge. Their fear is based on their uneasy consciences, not on Joseph’s behavior. He has given them no reason to think that he is vindictive.

16
Your father. They know from experience that Joseph accedes to his father’s authority in family matters. They hope he will respect Jacob’s instructions to forgive them even as he acceded to the burial instructions.

17
Joseph wept. He weeps for the second time in this scene: first for his father (50:1), then for his brothers. He probably weeps because, after seventeen years of kindness to them that reinforced his original forgiveness of them (45:7–8), they still misunderstand his goodness and think that he will at last take his revenge (see “Characterization” in Literary Analysis of Book 10, Act 4).

19
Am I in the place of God? This is how they seem to regard him (cf. 50:17–18). The rhetorical question expects a negative answer (cf. 30:2). He is only God’s instrument, not his surrogate. Moreover, only God could use their evil to do good. Joseph directs their attention away from himself to the sovereign God who rules their history. He is aware of the limits of his authority.

20
God intended it for good. God transformed the brothers’ evil intentions and actions to kill into his good intentions and actions to save life. Hence, there is no need for Joseph to hold a grudge. However, if they had not repented, they would still have been under divine wrath. Judas Iscariot also served God’s purpose (1 Cor. 2:8), but it would have been better for him had he never been born (Matt. 26:24).

Providence
God’s beneficent blessings come about through his sovereignty. The major theme of Book 10, God’s providence, finds classic expression in 50:20. G. von Rad says, “The statement about the brothers’ evil plans and God’s good plans now opens up the inmost mystery of the Joseph story. It is in every respect, along with the similar passage in ch. 45:5–7, the climax to the whole. Even where no man could imagine it, God had all the strings in his hand.” Brueggemann adds, “[T]hey could not see that in the midst of their scheme was another plan about which none of them knew, a plan hidden but sure in its work.

Burial, immortality and resurrection 
The Israelites were certainly concerned with proper burial practices (2 Sam. 1:11–17; 3:31; Isa. 14:19; Jer. 8:1–3; 16:1–9; Ezek. 24:15–17). Even sacred burial signified holy life with God.

Other texts explicitly teach the everlasting relationship of the pious with their God: they will know joy and eternal pleasures at God’s right hand (Ps. 16:11); the grave cannot rob them of life in God’s presence (Ps. 17:15; 73:24); they will dwell forever in his house (Ps. 23:6). Proverbs declares that righteousness delivers from death (Prov. 10:2) and that immortality is found on the path of righteousness (Prov. 12:28), and so even in death the righteous seek refuge in the Lord (Prov. 14:32).

Although the doctrine of immortality and resurrection at the end of history is only brought into full light by the resurrection of Christ (cf. 2 Tim. 1:10), some Old Testament texts already anticipate that resurrection of the dead will liberate the bodies of the righteous from the grave (Job 19:25–27; Isa. 26:19; Dan. 12:1–3). No human being can redeem another from Sheol, the common fate of both the wise and fools (Ps. 49:7, 10), but “God will redeem my life from the Sheol,” says the psalmist, “he will surely take me to himself” (Ps. 49:15).

The dead lie sleeping in their tombs; at the moment of resurrection, they will rise up again (Heb. qûm: 2 Kings 13:21; Isa. 26:14, 19; Job 14:12).… The dead are sleeping now; they will be awakened (2 Kings 4:31; Isa. 26:19; Job 14:12; Dan. 12:2) and, finally, they will come back to life (1 Kings 17:22; 2 Kings 13:21; Isa. 26:14, 19; Ezek. 37:3, 5–6, 9–10, 14; Job 14:14).

Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. For the first time the three patriarchs are mentioned together; that era has passed, but not its hope.

Covenant Blessings
The covenant themes of Genesis—blessing, seed, and land—continue through this final scene of the book. This closing scene of Genesis is about God’s blessing on his chosen people through the generations. Joseph’s genealogy to the third generation features God’s faithfulness to give seed.

Also, that blessing is poured on the head of the covenant partner who in spite of great wrongs done against him remained loyal to God and Israel. He expresses his loyalties by prophesying that God will bring Israel back to the land promised to the patriarchs and by instructing his family to bury him in that land. “By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones” (Heb. 11:22). The similarity of the deaths of Jacob and Joseph, both having died in Egypt but being buried in the sworn land, unites Joseph’s generation with the patriarchs. The covenant-keeping God showers blessings on those who keep the faith of the fathers

God’s Intervention
Throughout Israel’s history, God intervenes to deliver his people. To each generation, he reveals his sovereignty and the hope of deliverance. God reveals to Abraham Israel’s afflictions in Egypt, and to Joseph, the promise of rescue. A fuller visitation of God’s aid comes in the birth of Jesus Christ (see Luke 1:68), and the New Testament ends with the expectation of his visitation from heaven when all believers will experience their final exodus from death and this world to meet their Lord (see Rev. 22:20).
