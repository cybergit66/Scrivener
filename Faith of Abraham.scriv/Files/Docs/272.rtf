\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0      \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93After these things the word of the }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\scaps Lord}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  came to Abram in a vision: \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great\u8217\'92\u8221\'94 (Genesis 15:1). On the heels of a great military victory and grand recognition by Melchizedek, God commands Abraham to not allow himself to be overcome with fear. We know that Abraham succumbed to fear while in Egypt, but what circumstance might be tempting him to succumb at this point in time? Did have a close call with death during the most recent battle? Did he fear retaliation from the mighty powers he just defeated? Whatever the source, the Lord wants Abraham to depend upon him for safety and security. When God first called Abraham, He promised \u8220\'93I will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you I will curse\u8221\'94 (Genesis 12:3). Melchizedek acknowledged that God delivered Abraham\u8217\'92s enemies into his hand. Now God reaffirms his commitment to protect Abraham and to shield him from all the dangers on his faith journey. God will not allow any enemies to defeat Abraham and nullify His promises. God will continually guide and reassure Abraham so that he will not give up and lose faith during difficult times. We must remember that God continues to protect, help, and strengthen us today. Instead of looking corporations and governments to ease our fears, we should adopt the attitude of David who wrote \u8220\'93the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold\u8221\'94 (Psalms 18:2).}
