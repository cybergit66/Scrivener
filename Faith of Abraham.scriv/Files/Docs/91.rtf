\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Here, Abraham received the greatest test of his life: God commanded him to sacrifice his son, Isaac! This had to create a great crisis within Abraham\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s soul. He and Sarah had waited years for the fulfillment of the promise. In addition, he had already lost his first son Ishmael. Now the Lord was commanding Abraham to put to death the most precious person in his life. Giving up the choice of best land to Lot was one thing. Sacrificing Isaac and extinguishing the hope of the promise was quite another!}}
