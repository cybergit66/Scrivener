What is the meaning of the term “world” that lies behind the exhortation μὴ ἀγαπᾶτε τὸν κόσμον μηδὲ τὰ ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ (“Do not love the world or the things in the world”)? That it is not the world as a creation of God, and that it is also not the world of men, is self-evident. It is the κόσμος οὗτος (“this world”) of 4:17*; Jn 12:31*; 16:11*; 18:36*; 1 Cor 3:19*; 5:10*; 7:31*; Eph 2:2*, in the sense of the sphere which is distinguished and separated from God, but not in the sense of an active opposition to God and the believers, as in 3:13*; Jn 7:7*; 15:18f*, 24*; 17:14*, but rather in the sense of its nothingness, as v 17* shows.18
