Abram says to Sarai:

  When the Egyptians shall see thee … they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
  Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee (Genesis 12:12–13).

Is this the same man who trusted God, of whom we read, “He was the friend of God,” and “the father of the faithful”? Yes, it is the same man—none other than this same Abram, Abram’s action only proves how deceitful the flesh is, even in the believer, and how we ought to be on guard against it every moment. The Bible knows no such thing as the eradication of the flesh while we are here below. It is still in us to overpower us the moment we are off guard and leave the place of perfect obedience. The saintliest and holiest believer is not immune to the flesh and temptation, but is all too prone to yield and submit to it when it appears that obedience to God may cost him too great a price.
