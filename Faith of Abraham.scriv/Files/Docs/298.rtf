\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24 We take the position that circumcision is a means by which Abraham and his seed ratify God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lordship over them. It is their identity sign as God\u8217\'92s covenant people. As such, circumcision is not a cognition sign, one for God\u8217\'92s benefit, but rather a confirmation sign, one bearing witness to Abraham\u8217\'92s belief that God would fulfill his promises with respect to progeny. Accordingly, Abraham\u8217\'92s circumcision is as much an amen to Yahweh as was his affirmation in 15:6.\{\\Scrv_fn=}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  Hamilton, V. P.
