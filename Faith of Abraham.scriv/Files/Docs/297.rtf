\pard\plain \fi720\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Now God states Abraham\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s covenant responsibility -  \u8220\'93}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 (Genesis 17:10). Just as the rainbow was the sign of God\u8217\'92s covenant with Noah, circumcision becomes the sign of this covenant. Circumcision, the cutting of the foreskin from the genitalia, was to be performed on male infants the eighth day after their birth and on all older males, even upon slaves and foreigners born outside of Abraham\u8217\'92s household. Thus, God\u8217\'92s covenant with Abraham extended beyond non-elect and non-biological lines. Hamilton notes that the Lord established circumcision as the sign of the covenant to bear witness to Abraham\u8217\'92s faith in God\u8217\'92s promises. It was an amen to the Lord\u8217\'92s word as was his faith in Genesis 15:6 (Hamilton, p. 472). Those who rejected circumcision, thus the condition of being included in the covenant, were to be cut off from God\u8217\'92s people (Genesis 17:14).}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As Christians, we participate in the new covenant established by Jesus the night before he died when he told his disciples while instituting the Lord\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Supper, \u8220\'93}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 (Luke 22:20). After his resurrection, the Lord sent out his disciples not to circumcise, but to call would-be Christians to faith and baptism: \u8220\'93Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned\u8221\'94 (Mark 16:15-16). In Acts 15:28 we read that the apostles and the early church recognized that one does not have to be physically circumcised in order to participate in the new covenant. In fact Paul wrote \u8220\'93For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation\u8221\'94 (Galatians 6:15).}
