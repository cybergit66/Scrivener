\pard\plain \fi720\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Abraham\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s response indicates that the reward God speaks of includes offspring: }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93O Lord }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\scaps God}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 (Genesis 15:2). Abraham goes on to express a sense of hopelessness. God\u8217\'92s delay has led Abraham to conclude that it looks like his chief servant, Eliezer, will end up being his heir. Waltke writes that there is \u8220\'93some evidence that in Abraham\u8217\'92s culture a childless man could adopt someone to be the guardian and heir of his estate as compensation for the person\u8217\'92s performing the duties of a son. If a son was subsequently born, the adopted man could not disinherit the natural son\u8221\'94 (p. 241). It appears that Abraham has an alternate plan in place should he and Sarah fail to conceive a son. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 However, God reassured Abraham that he and Sarah will give birth to a son who will be his heir. In the midst of Abraham\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s concern about not yet having a son, the Lord takes him outside during the night and tells him that he will produce as many offspring as the number of stars in the sky! Abraham\u8217\'92s response reveals the reason why he is called the father of the faithful: \u8220\'93And he believed the }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\scaps Lord}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , and he counted it to him as righteousness\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 (Genesis 15:6). What was true of Abraham is true of us today. All of us have sinned and fallen short of God\u8217\'92s glory. We have created a debt with God that we can never settle through good works or law-keeping. We all stand guilty before God. However, we all are made righteous before God through faith in Jesus (Romans 4:22). The apostle Paul wrote, \u8220\'93}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\super 27\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 (Galatians 3:26-27).}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  It is through faith that we become Abraham\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s seed and heir according to the promise God gave to him (Galatians 3:28-29).}}
