\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Throughout his life, Abraham faced many tests of his faith with mixed results. The first one consisted of God calling him to leave his relatives and homeland for a land God had yet to show him. When he arrived in Canaan, a famine arose that forced Abraham to go to Egypt where he faced the danger of loosing his life and wife to Pharaoh. Thereafter, a great conflict arose between Abraham\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s and Lot\u8217\'92s herdsmen that forced a separation between the two camps, with Lot choosing more fertile territory to dwell in. As the years of Sarah\u8217\'92s infertility lengthened, the delay tested the couple\u8217\'92s resolve to wait on God\u8217\'92s promise of an heir. Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to be a surrogate mother, which led to the conception and birth of Ishmael. After the birth of his promised son Isaac, Abraham was again tested when Sarah demanded that Hagar and Ishmael be cast out of their household. In Genesis 22, Abraham\u8217\'92s faith will meet its greatest challenge.}
