\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Abraham led his whole household to obey and to enter into a covenant relationship with God by following His instructions for circumcision (Genesis 15:22). Though it seemed incredulous that God would fulfill His seed promise through Sarah, Abraham accepted and surrendered to God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s will and purpose. We must be willing to do the same today. The church needs men and women to be willing to obey God\u8217\'92s word at all costs. We all experience moments of temporary doubt concerning the willingness and power of God to deliver. Oftentimes, we don\u8217\'92t see how God can or will pull us through situations such as financial hardship or relational conflict. That puts us in the same company with Abraham and Sarah. However, we must remember that our Lord is full of grace and that He will remain faithful to us in our weaknesses, limitations, and faults. He supplies the spiritual power we need to live by faith, far more than we can ask for or imagine (Ephesians 3:20). He is committed to fulfilling His promises to us and will bring to completion His work of transformation in us at the day of our Lord Jesus (Philippians 1:6). }}
