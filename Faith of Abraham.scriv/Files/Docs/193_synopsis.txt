The situation of the patriarchs is, in important ways, analogous to that of the Christian addressees, whose commitment has alienated them from their earthly “homeland” (10:32–34*). These new sojourners will soon be summoned again to follow the ultimate example of faith by accepting the suffering that comes with their alien status (12:1–3*; 13:13*).
