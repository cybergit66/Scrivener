Scholars debate the precise identification of Ur of the Chaldeans from which Abram moved. The excavations of Sir Leonard Woolley at Ur in the 1920s and 1930 have led many to assume that the Ur from which Abram departed is the Sumerian Ur, that is, the great city in Lower Mesopotamia located on the Euphrates.

Other scholars have challenged this identification and suggested that Abram’s Ur is to be located in Upper Mesopotamia. Before Sumerian Ur came to light, writers were already equating Abraham’s Ur with Urfa (now called Edessa), which is about twenty miles northwest of Haran. A more recent proposal is to identify the Ur of Gen. 11 with a town called Ura in Hittite territory.
