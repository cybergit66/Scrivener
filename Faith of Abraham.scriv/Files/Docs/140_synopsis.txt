Now comes the most wonderful exhibition of the grace of God in behalf of those who belong to Him, even though they are disobedient. While Abram was unfaithful, God remained faithful. We might expect God to say, “Well, Abram, you got yourself into this mess, now you can stew in your own fat. I am going to give you up. I’m all through with you. I’ll call somebody else.” Did God do anything of the kind? Listen to the record:

  And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife (Genesis 12:17).
