These were allies of Abram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 (14:13). Here, Abraham is known as \u8216\'91the Hebrew\u8217\'92, an ethnic term connected with Eber (Waltke, p.231). Eber was the last ancestor in the genealogy of Shem before God disrupted the building of the tower of Babel (10:21-25). Abraham is a legitimate descendant of Shem which distinguishes him from the other residents of Canaan. Abraham had formed an alliance with Mamre the Amorite and his two brothers prior to the defeat of Sodom and the capture of Lot. Apparently, Abraham wisely anticipated the need to ally himself with reliable men who would join him to combat unseen dangers and opposition. We should follow Abraham\u8217\'92s example by forming strong relationships with other Christians within the local congregation so that we can have strong spiritual support when we face struggles and opposition.  }}
