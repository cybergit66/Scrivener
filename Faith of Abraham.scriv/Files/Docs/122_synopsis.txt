Still, Abram’s decision to travel to Egypt revealed a surprising lack of faith, especially since it came directly on the heels of God’s call and promise to him (Gen 12:1–9). God had instructed Abram to go “to the land that I will show you” (Gen 12:1), promising that the land would belong to him and his descendants (Gen 12:7). Given God’s recent promise, Abram should have had more confidence.
