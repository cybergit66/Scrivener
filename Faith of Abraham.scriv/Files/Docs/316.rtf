\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Human sin will alway be met by either God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mercy or judgment. Lot and his family did not merit the opportunity to escape God\u8217\'92s judgment, but we read that the Lord patiently endured Lot\u8217\'92s reluctant to let go of his life in Sodom. Like Lot we have spent many years in vanity and pride, but through God\u8217\'92s great patience, mercy and grace we received salvation.  Let us be mindful that choosing to live by the lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of possessions rather than by faith in the promises of God leads to a dead end. Small \u8216\'91sinful\u8217\'92 decisions can create a slow fade that leads enormous consequences and great loss. We show also take note that the plunge into perverse depravity begins with our  failure to gratefully acknowledge God. When divine restraint is removed from the human heart, men and women sink deeper into sin. God disciplines His children as a loving Father in order to prevent this from happening, but He will judge the impenitent as those in Sodom discovered. }}
