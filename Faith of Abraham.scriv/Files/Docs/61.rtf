\pard\plain \fi240\qj\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land\u8221\'94 (12:10). After having obeyed God\u8217\'92s call to go to Canaan and receiving reassurance of the promise, Abraham is confronted with a difficult trial of his faith - he finds himself in the midst of a severe famine. The future looks dim in Canaan. This situation presented an issue of life and death to Abraham and his family. He may have asked God, \u8220\'93I thought you were going to make me into a great nation?\u8221\'94 Abraham now had to choose between remaining in the land of promise, thus risking starvation or moving on to greener pastures where his family could survive. In Abraham\u8217\'92s day Egypt was a popular destination to escape famine because agriculture in Egypt was more dependent on the regular flooding of the Nile river. So, Abraham decided to take matters into his own hands and moved his family to Egypt. Did his decision represent a lack of faith in God\u8217\'92s ability to fulfill His promises in Canaan? Maybe so. On the other hand, Abraham may have rationalized that a dead man could not father a great nation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, \u8216\'91I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance, and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, \u8216\'91This is his wife.\u8217\'92 Then they will kill me, but they will let you live. Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake\u8217\'92\u8221\'94 (12:11-13). There is no doubt that now Abraham demonstrates a lack of faith driven by fear and self-preservation. Instead of trusting God to protect him, Abraham made a self-centered decision to engage in deception. We learn from Genesis 20:13 that when God called him to leave his father\u8217\'92s house, Abraham feared losing his life to powerful men in dangerous territories who might be attracted to his beautiful wife. Now that they are about to enter Egypt and face Pharaoh, Abraham convinces Sarah to enact their brother-sister routine so that he might receive a bride price from interested suitors. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Does this sound like the same man who demonstrated great faith by leaving family, friends, and homeland in pursuit of a promise he has not seen? Is this the same man who displayed great devotion to God by building altars of worship to the one true God in pagan lands? Here we see that Abraham, known as the friend of God and father of the faithful, struggled with sin and fear as we do today. The Scriptures provide plenty examples of God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s faithful succumbing to sin: Noah and his drunkenness; David and Bathsheba; and Peter\u8217\'92s denial of the Lord. Abraham\u8217\'92s actions shows how deceitful sin is and that we all need to be watchful and vigilant in prayer because the flesh will never be completely  done away with in this life. We all should keep in mind the admonition \u8220\'93therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall\u8221\'94 (1 Corinthians 10:12).}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh\u8217\'92s house. And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels\u8221\'94 (12:14-16). Abraham\u8217\'92s fears become realized. Sarah\u8217\'92s beauty has captured the attention of Pharaoh\u8217\'92s princes and consequently she ends up in Pharaoh\u8217\'92s house! In exchange, Abraham is living the high life as he receives animals and servants. What might Sarah be thinking and feeling at this point? Anger? Abandonment? Disappointment? We don\u8217\'92t know Sarah\u8217\'92s state of mind at this point but we do know she\u8217\'92s married to a flawed man of faith. }}
