In the NT, the Greek word μετανοέω (metanoeō) means “to change the mind”; the related noun μετάνοια (metanoia) means “change of mind” (Mark 1:4, 15). Repentance is thus understood as a process in which the individual reorients the mind and will—away from sin and toward God. Like Hebrew, Greek can also express repentance or conversion as turning back to God with the verb ἐπιστρέφω (epistrephō, “to turn back”; Matt 13:15).
