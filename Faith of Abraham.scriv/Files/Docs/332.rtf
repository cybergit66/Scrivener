And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 (Genesis 21:1-2). Sarah gave birth to Isaac when Abraham was 100 years old, at the time appointed by the Lord. He had possibly grown accustomed to the idea that if things did not work out as promised, his eldest son Ishmael would be the inheritor. However, God planned His promise to unfold as it did to display His faithfulness and power. God always keeps His word, but the delay is often longer than we like and filled with various trials. During the interim we can learn to endure, to become stronger, to trust more, to pray and grow closer to God. As we do so, God will visit us just as He visited Sarah. He will gracefully provide us the strength we need to accomplish His will. Our attitude towards the Lord should be \u8220\'93I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted\u8221\'94 (Job 42:1-2). }}
