Abram was an idolater. He came from a pagan country and from a pagan nation and from a pagan home. His family worshipped idols, and estranged themselves from the one true God. Joshua gives us this little bit of information in Joshua 24:2. In speaking to Israel he says:

  Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.
