To make his point the author gives a definition of everything in the world. This definition involves three elements. The first of these is the cravings of sinful man (lit. ‘the desire of the flesh’ [hē epithymia tēs sarkos]). The word “desire” (epithymia) is found 38 times in the NT. In only three places does it have positive connotations (Luke 22:15; Phil 1:23; 1 Thess 2:17); in all the rest it has morally negative connotations, as it does in the present context, where the NIV translates it as ‘cravings’. This is a general category, and the second and third elements of those things which comprise the world are subcategories.80 The second of them is the lust of his eyes (lit. ‘the desire of the eyes’), that is, those sinful cravings which are activated by what people see, and lead to covetousness. Covetousness is one part of what makes up the ‘cravings of sinful man’ in this context. The third element is his pride in possessions (lit. ‘pride of life’, alazoneia tou biou). The word bios has a range of meanings, including ‘life’, ‘livelihood’, ‘living’, ‘property’, and ‘possessions’. It is used in 3:17 clearly with the sense of property or possessions, and this is the predominant use of the word in the NT. To construe it here, then, as ‘possessions’, as the NIV does, not only makes good sense but is also in line with the only other use of the word in 1 John (see 3:17) and the predominant use in the NT. Being puffed up in pride because of one’s material possessions is the second of those things which make up the ‘cravings of sinful man’ in this passage.
