What is it in your own life, Christian, which hinders you and keeps you from the joy of the Christian life? From what do you need to be separated? You know what it is. Is it some secret sin, some habit, some lust, some fleshly thing you are pampering and condoning and excusing? Is it some worldly practice, pride, dishonesty, gossip, an unforgiving spirit, bitterness, a sharp tongue, an uncontrolled and unyielded temper, stubbornness or hatred? Remember, before you can go on, it must go.
