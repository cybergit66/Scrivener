Worldliness and greed will destroy us. Therefore, when God calls us to turn away from the worldliness and greed of family members, it is not a heartless demand.
⇒	It is simply the demand that we focus our minds and hearts first of all upon God.
⇒	It is simply the demand that we put God first in our lives, before family members, even before father or mother.
⇒	It is simply the demand that we seek God first, seek Him even before food, shelter, and clothing.
⇒	It is simply the demand that we focus our attention and affections on things above, lasting things, not on things of the earth, things that are temporary.
“Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth” (Col. 3:2).
⇒	It is simply the demand that we not trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God.
“Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy” (1 Ti. 6:17).
