Abraham’s story begins with God’s call to venture from the “city of man” and family security to find the city of God. It is a call that every saint hears and that guides God’s people on their pilgrimage to the celestial city. Readers perceive themselves as recipients or addressees of these direct acts of commitment or of promise. They are members of this community.
