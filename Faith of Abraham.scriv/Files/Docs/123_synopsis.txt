On some level, Abram’s lack of faith was driven by the overwhelming instinct of self-preservation: He didn’t want to die. This also manifested as a lack of concern for Sarai. Abram persuaded her to participate in his deception, claiming that he would be killed if she did not. He failed to recognize that because of their ploy, an Egyptian would take her as his wife. Abram’s concern for his own survival blinded him to the issues of Sarai’s purity and protection.
