The only passage in the NT to emphasize the element of uncertainty in the commencement of Abraham’s faith pilgrimage is Heb. 11:8. Indeed, Heb. 11:8 offers the most definite assertion of this uncertainty (more so even than Genesis) with the addition of the phrase “even though he did not know where he was going.”
