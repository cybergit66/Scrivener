"Abram's faith was again tested by trial (Gen 13:2Â­7). While Abram failed the early
tests in Egypt, he acted selflessly later, allowing Lot to choose the best area of land.
The pairing of these two stories develops a fuller picture of Abram's faith journey: He
had both successes and failures when attempting to follow God's will. Together, these
stories teach us that although our faith might not be perfect, God's continued faithful-
ness to us is."
