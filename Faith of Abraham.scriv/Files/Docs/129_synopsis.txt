Living in response to God’s call requires that we continually purge ourselves of self-centeredness—or “self-preservation,” as in Abram’s case. But God’s faithfulness to us ensures that even when we find ourselves off course—whether because of a decision made in fear or a sin that has overcome us—His grace will guide us back to His will.
