\pard\plain \fi240\qj\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 After God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s destruction of the cities of the Plain, Lot and his two daughters leave Zoar to live in the hills. Lot has hit rock bottom and lost everything, including his wife. Concerned about their lack of marital prospects and wanting to produce offspring, his daughters conspire to incestuously have heirs by Lot (Genesis 19:31-32). This plan, borne out of fear and not faith in God, speaks volumes about their value system. On two separate occasions the daughters made Lot drunk, slept with him and consequently gave birth to two sons who will be the fathers of the Moabites and Ammonites }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 (Genesis 19:32-38). Ironically, these two people groups will be bitter foes of Abraham\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s elect descendants (Israel) and thus rejected by God (Deuteronomy 23:3-6). Yet, the lineage of Moab will produce Ruth, who because of her faith will be included among the tribe of Judah and become an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Ruth 4:18-22; Matthew 1:5). }}
