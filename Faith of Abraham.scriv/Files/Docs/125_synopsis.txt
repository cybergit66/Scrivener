Ultimately, God preserved Abram and faithfully kept His promise despite Abram’s seemingly impossible choice—death in Canaan or death in Egypt—and his poor decisions. As we read these accounts, we can recognize times in our own lives when the choices we make seem to lead us off track and away from God. And yet, in such cases, God is still present and able to bring us through any circumstance. He is faithful to His promise.
