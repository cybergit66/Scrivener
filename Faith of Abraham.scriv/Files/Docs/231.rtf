\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Famines were not unusual in ancient Mesopotamia. Often caused by drought, famines jeopardized the food supplies of animals and people alike, and they quickly became a matter of life and death. Agriculture in Egypt was less dependent on rain than agriculture in Canaan: The regular flooding of the Nile provided water for crops. During times of famine, people living in Canaan often traveled to Egypt, knowing they would likely find food there. Egyptian tomb carvings from around the 20th century BC such as the Beni Hasan mural show Semitic people traveling to Egypt.}
