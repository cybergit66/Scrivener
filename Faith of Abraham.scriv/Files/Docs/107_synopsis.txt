The Hebrew word moledeth can be used to refer to someone’s homeland (Ruth 2:11; Jer 22:10), birthplace (Jer 46:16; Ezek 16:3), relatives (Gen 43:7; Num 10:30), or children (Gen 48:6). Aside from its use in Gen 12:1, the word occurs eight more times in Genesis. Unfortunately, “birthplace” and “relatives” work equally well in many of the contexts where moledeth occurs. However, in Genesis 12:1 “birthplace” makes more sense than “relatives” since “father’s house” at the end of the list clearly indicates Abram’s extended family
