      17       Therefore go out from their midst, 
      and be separate from them, says the Lord, 
                  and touch no unclean thing; 
      then I will welcome you, 
            18       and I will be a father to you, 
      and you shall be sons and daughters to me, 
                  says the Lord Almighty.” 
7 Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.
