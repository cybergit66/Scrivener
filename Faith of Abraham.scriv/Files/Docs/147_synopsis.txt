Heb. môleḏeṯ (from yālaḏ) can mean “birthplace,” and if that is the case here, then we would have further support for Abram coming from Upper Mesopotamia. In some OT passages (esp. Gen. 43:7; 48:6; Esth. 8:6) this word is translated as “descendants, offspring, kindred,” perhaps suggesting that Haran was the place where his family and descendants lived
