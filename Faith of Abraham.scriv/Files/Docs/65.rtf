\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This episode in Abram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s life demonstrates that for us faithful living involves both failure and success. Though Abram failed miserably under cowardice in Egypt, he responded peacefully through humility and meekness to the conflict that threaten his relationship with Lot. Abram trusted God to provide. Thus, he was able to let Lot choose what appears to be the best land to support his livestock. By contrast, Lot makes a decision that takes him away from godly influence and puts himself in dire circumstances. Consequently, God reaffirmed his promise to Abram to give him all the land and to make him a great nation. In a sense, Abram points us to our Lord Jesus who humbled himself to crucifixion on the cross and then was highly exalted by God above every creature in heaven and on earth (Philippians 2:9-11). May we keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and seek to live, through the power of the Spirit, as selflessly as he. }}
