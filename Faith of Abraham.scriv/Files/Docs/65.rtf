\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This episode in Abraham\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s life demonstrates that for us faithful living involves both failure and success. Though Abraham failed miserably under cowardice in Egypt, he responded peacefully through humility and meekness to the conflict that threaten his and Lot\u8217\'92s relationship. In a magnanimous act, Abraham trusted God to provide in letting Lot choose what appears to be the best land to support his livestock. By contrast, Lot makes a decision that takes him away from godly influence and puts himself in dire circumstances. Consequently, God reaffirms his promise to Abram to give him all the land and to make him a great nation. In a sense, Abraham points us to our Lord Jesus who humbled himself to crucifixion on the cross and then is highly exalted by God above every creature in heaven and on earth (Php. 2:9-11). May we keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and seek to live, through the power of the Spirit, as selflessly as he. }}
