The introduction of Abram represents a major turning point in the story of Genesis. God’s previous interactions with humanity, from Adam to the Babel event, were marked by discord and conflict. Abram’s responsive acceptance of God contrasted sharply with humanity’s continual resistance (except for Noah; see Gen 6:9–8:22). With Abram, God finally found someone who embraced His offer of blessing in exchange for obedience.
