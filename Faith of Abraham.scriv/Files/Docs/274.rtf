\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Abraham accepted God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s promise concerning offspring, but he asks for confirmation about the land promise (Genesis 15:8). What follows is a covenant ceremony initiated by the Lord, who instructs Abraham to bring him a heifer, a female goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon. The ceremony proceeded with Abraham cutting the large animals in half, laying the pieces in opposite rows with the birds at opposite ends. Abraham falls into a divinely induced deep sleep at sunset and for the first time the Lord gives him the specific details of how he will possess the land of Canaan. God reveals to Abraham }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 that himself will not possess it, but }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 that his offspring will come into possession of the land after four hundred years of servitude in another land. Their return to Canaan will be the occasion of God judging the Amorites (representative of the native Canaanites). }}
