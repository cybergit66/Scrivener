The Migration. Abraham’s story begins with his migration with the rest of his family from UR of the Chaldeans in ancient southern Babylonia (Gen. 11:31). He and his family moved north along the trade routes of the ancient world and settled in the flourishing trade center of HARAN, several hundred miles to the northwest.
