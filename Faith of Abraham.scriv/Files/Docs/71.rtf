\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In this lesson we learn several things about God. First, God is the protector of His faithful people. Just as God protected His faitful warrior Abraham, we \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93by God\u8217\'92s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time\u8221\'94 (1 Peter 1:5). Second, God reveals himself as the \u8216\'91LORD GOD\u8217\'92, the one who is sovereign over history. He has all power and authority to govern who possesses the land of Canaan at any given time. Third, just as }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 God revealed the specifics of His promises to Abraham in progressive stages to sustain his faith, }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 God gives us what we need at the appropriate time in our spiritual journeys. Fourth, God will remain faithful to His word despite our failures and weaknesses. As we encounter the struggles of life, we should not let our feelings overrule the need to allow the truth of God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words to guide our thinking. }}
