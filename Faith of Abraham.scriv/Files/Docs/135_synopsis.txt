The greatest need of the church and of Christians today is to learn the lesson of separation from the world and from the flesh. Thousands of Christians are at a dead standstill (like Abram in Haran), groping in doubt and fear and uncertainty, having made no progress because of the fleshly habits and sins in their lives.
