The OT concept of repentance is expressed with two key Hebrew terms: שׁוּב (šûb) and נָחַם (nāḥam). The Hebrew word šûb (“turn”) expresses repentance as turning away from the wrong path, i.e., sinful behavior, and turning back toward God (Hos 3:5). Thus, repentance is an act of reorientation. The term nāḥam (“console”) can have a number of different meanings, including feeling sorrow or remorse; it can thus express the aspect of repentance that involves contrition for wrongdoing (Job 42:6).
