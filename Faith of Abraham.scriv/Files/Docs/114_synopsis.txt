Just like our own walks, Abram’s journey of faith was not perfect. Yet even though Abram continued to be nagged by doubt and fear, he kept looking ahead to where God was leading him. The Apostle Paul used Abram’s life to draw out the same truth: A true child of Abram lives by faith in the promised Son, who brings blessing to the entire world (Gal 3:6–9). The message of Abram’s life points to this essential truth of the gospel: We must live by faith in God, no matter what.
