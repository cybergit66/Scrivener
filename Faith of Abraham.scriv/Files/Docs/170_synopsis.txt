Abraham was born in *UR and moved with his wife Sarai, his father, brothers Nahor and Harran, and nephew Lot to Harran (Gn. 11:26–32). At the age of 75, on his father’s death, Abraham moved on to Palestine (Canaan) near Bethel, to Mamre near Hebron, and to Beersheba. At each place he set up an altar and tent-shrine.
