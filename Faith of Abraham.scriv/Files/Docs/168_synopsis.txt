“They came to Haran.” Haran is an ancient and well-known city on the left bank of the Belikh, a tributary of the Euphrates; in cuneiform it is Harrānu(m), often mentioned in the Mari texts. Some scholars think that the name is Hurrian (F. M. T. Böhl and others); later it was karrhä, today once more Harran. The city belonged to the Mitanni empire, then to the Hittite, and afterwards to the Assyrian. The last Assyrian king fled there, and the last Babylonian king, Nabonidus, favored it.
Haran is mentioned in the context of the patriarchal story in Gen. 11:31*, 32*; 12:4*, 5*; 27:43*; 28:10*; 29:4*; in Gen. 24 it is the city of Nahor, Laban, and Rebecca. Such extensive attestation points to the likelihood that it is the place of origin of Abraham’s ancestors.
