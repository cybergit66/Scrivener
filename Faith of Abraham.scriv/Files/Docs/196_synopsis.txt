More specifically, the present verse forms the minor premise of a syllogism:

    they said they were looking for a homeland (v. 14)
    it could not have been their earthly birthplace (v. 15)
    so it must have been a home in heaven (v. 16a).

Moreover, this whole argument is a midrash tied to ξένοι καὶ παρεπίδημοι in → v. 13, and thus ultimately to Abraham’s words in Gn. 23:4, though Jacob is associated with him, perhaps as a second witness, and the language of exile has wider implications. The argument, as Hebrews develops it, has no direct basis in the OT text. Its immediate basis, moreover, is not Abraham’s words themselves, but the conclusion drawn from them in v. 14 that Abraham, and thus by implication the fathers generally, were looking for a homeland (still to be defined). This homeland, the author argues, could not have been Ur because Abraham knew where it was and could have returned there at any time. In fact, not only did he not do so, but he prevented his descendants from doing so
