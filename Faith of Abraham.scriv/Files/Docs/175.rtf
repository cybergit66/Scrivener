\pard\plain \fi720\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Worldliness can be defined as a love for and a willingness to conform to the sinful values and practices of society. In addition, it can include attachment to the things (good or bad) of this life. This is to be contrasted with a desire to seek God, conform one\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s life to His ways and living by faith in His promises. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In leaving his homeland, he demonstrated detachment from the things of this life. The writer of Hebrews argues that Abram was looking for a homeland, but that it was a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93better one, a heavenly homeland\u8221\'94 (Hebrews 11:13-16). Abraham valued the promises of God over the things he possessed in Mesopotamia or would acquire in his travels. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Like Abraham, we are called to value the things of God above the temporal things of this life. Our Lord Jesus commanded, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93\u8230\'85seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.\u8221\'94 We are often consumed with physical necessities, but the life of faith is one of preoccupation with doing God\u8217\'92s will driven by love for Him. We  often lay up treasures on earth, but the life of faith demands that we set our affections on the eternal things of God. We often seek to make as much money as we can (greed - to seek riches), but the life of faith demands that we seek to be generous and help those in need. }}
