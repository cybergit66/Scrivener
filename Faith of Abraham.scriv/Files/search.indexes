            <Text>In less than ten generations after God commanded Noah and his sons to “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (Ge. 9:3, ESV), mankind had rebelled against God’s mandate and decided to build a world order apart from God’s guidance. It was this type of self-determination which lead the first family (Adam and Eve) to sin against God and plunged humanity into a cesspool of violence and immorality (Ge. 6:1-6). Humanity’s state of being and the conditions on earth grieved the Lord. In an act of judgment and mercy, God sent the Great Flood to destroy mankind, but he spared Noah and his family. This time, God’s reaction to mankind’s rebellion culminating at the Tower of Babel consisted of God dividing the world into nations. Through the lineage of Shem, God will initiate the next phase in His plan to crush the head of the Serpent by choosing one man to be his instrument to bless the world - Abraham.
In Genesis 11:27-32, we learn that Abramham’s family originated in Ur of the Chaldeans. Scholars debate the precise identification of Ur, but most accept modern Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq as the location. Lead by his father Terah, Abraham migrated with his family from Ur to Haran after the death of his brother Haran. Both Ur and Haran were ancient centers for the worship of the moon god Sin - we learn from Joshua 24:2 that Abraham’s family worshipped pagan deities. While living in Haran, Terah died and apparently Abraham (then known as Abram)assumed leadership of the clan which included his barren wife Sarai and his nephew Lot. </Text>

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in standard manuscript format with sub-headings inside the chapters.

How To Use This Template
Edit the Title Page document to ensure it contains the correct information.
Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter Subtitle”.
Create a new text document for each sub-section within the chapter folders, giving each the title of the subheading you wish to appear in the text. You can nest text documents for smaller subheadings, like this:
￼
If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface” or “Introduction” if you prefer. If you would rather the foreword come after the table of contents—as is sometimes the case—drag the “Foreword” document and drop it below the “Contents” document.
If you are compiling to the RTF file format or if you have Microsoft Office installed and are compiling to DOC, DOCX, PDF or Print, you can create a table of contents. Before compiling, simply select all the documents you wish to be included in the contents listing (usually this will be the “Foreword”, all chapter folders, and “Endnotes”, but not the nested sub-sections), then go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as ToC. Paste into the “Contents” document below the “Contents” title. The resulting linked text and page number tags will be replaced with the final chapter names and page numbers in the compiled document. You can format the contents however you wish, for example removing the underlines or indenting subsections if you chose to include them. You don’t need to do this every time you compile, just when chapters have been added, deleted, renamed or moved around. (Note to Microsoft Word users: If you export to Word, you may need to generate a print preview in Word to force the page numbers to show up correctly—they may appear as question marks before doing so.) Deselect “Include in compile” for the Contents document in the inspector if you do not want it in your final output.
If you have no footnotes or endnotes in your text, be sure to delete the “Endnotes” document.
“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Compile your manuscript into standard manuscript format by selecting File &gt; Compile. The “Front Matter” folder is already selected for inclusion in the compile Contents pane.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include. You will also need to edit the title prefix in the “Section Layout”.
Hierarchical numbering: If you require hierarchical numbering for sub-sections, choose “Non-Fiction with Sub-Heads (Hierarchical)” from the “Format As” menu in Compile. Alternatively, edit the “Section Layout” for each level in the “Formatting” pane of Compile and add the “&lt;$hn&gt;” (for “hierarchical numbering”) tag to the title prefixes. 
Page header: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings.

Sample Document
See the “Sample MS” PDF file in the Research folder for an example of a document that has been created using this template. This is what the “Draft” folder structure looked like in the binder for this sample document:

            <Synopsis>&quot;Abram's faith was again tested by trial (Gen 13:2­7). While Abram failed the early
tests in Egypt, he acted selflessly later, allowing Lot to choose the best area of land.
The pairing of these two stories develops a fuller picture of Abram's faith journey: He
had both successes and failures when attempting to follow God's will. Together, these
stories teach us that although our faith might not be perfect, God's continued faithful-
ness to us is.&quot;

            <Text>Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. 2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed” (Gen. 12:1-4).
God’s interactions with Abraham begins not only with a command to leave his family and homeland - but also He commands Abraham to go to a land God would show him. It should be noted that God had not provided Abraham with the details of the promised land. Abraham’s journey is very risky because his is merely pointed in the direction he should go, but given no information about his final destination. We read in Hebrews that “he went out, not knowing where he was going” (11:8b). Following God under these circumstances demanded great faith on Abraham’s part for he was dependent upon God for daily guidance, protection and sustenance. 
Furthermore, God’s promise to provide Abraham with a great nation presented a great challenge to his faith because Sarah was barren! Despite years of failing to produce children, Abraham (and Sarah) did not surrender to unbelief. Instead, they set out on a journey that will test their faith in God’s promises to the limit. Consequently, Abraham actions will have a significant impact upon humanity.</Text>

            <Title>Separation from the Past</Title>
            <Text>It’s most likely that prior to God calling him Abram was an idolater given what we read in Joshua 24:2 - “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods.’” God’s call to Abram necessitated that he disavow any allegiance to the gods of his fathers. The call demanded that he separate himself from idolatry.
Separation from one’s past sinful life is generally known as repentance. One key Hebrew word (šûb - “turn”) expresses repentance as turning away from the wrong path, i.e., sinful behavior, and turning back toward God (DiFransico, Lexham Theological Wordbook). The same idea is found in the New Testament with the Greek word metanoeō which means “to change one’s mind”, resulting in an re-orientation of one’s life (Bauer, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 640). Paul’s recognition of the Thessalonians conversion in 1 Thessalonians 1:9-10 highlights the nature of true repentance - “For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.” Just as God commanded Abram to leave his past behind and center his life on God’s promise, Jesus commands his followers leave behind their past way of living to serve him(Mark 1:15; Luke 13:3). 
As we will learn from the life of Abraham, repentance is not just a one-time event in the life of the Christian. Though known as the father of the faithful, Abraham suffered many faith failures. Each one proved to be a learning experience and over the course of his life Abraham’s trust in God grew. As we come to awareness of the sins and vices that hinder and keep us from experiencing the joy of the Christian life, we realize that there exist much room for spiritual growth in our lives. We must resolve, through the power of the Holy Spirit, to eliminate sinful habits and attitudes that prevent us from fully pursuing the life God intends for us to live. On the other hand, we learn to develop and pursue a lifestyle that will bring honor to God. Just as He did with Abraham, God will provide us the grace to grow in our faith!</Text>

            <Title>Cornerstone</Title>
            <Text>The account of God’s interactions with Abram begins with a call for Abram to leave his ancestral people and homeland: ‘Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you”’(Gen. 12:1, ESV). Leaving the comfort of home, family, and familiar surroundings can be quite a challenge because such a transition can remove one from the love, care, acceptance, and security of a strong support system - especially in ancient nomadic cultures. 
However, this is exactly what God demanded of Abram. The word “go” is lek-leka in Hebrew, which expresses that Abram is to “determinately dissociate himself” from his current environment (Bruce Waltke, Genesis: A commentary, 205). Hebrews 11:8 makes it clear that Abram forsook his home in obedience to God’s call. He obeyed not even knowing where he was going! He exchanged the known for the unknown, the familiar for the unfamiliar. God called Abram to a new life, but he had to leave his old life behind. Likewise, Christians have been called to a new life of discipleship which involves separation from the past life of sin, separation from the world, and possibly separation from family and friends.

            <Text>Abraham looms over Biblical history as the father of the faithful. His journey to this status began at age 75 when God called him leave his people and homeland. Abraham willingly left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, along with their belongings and people they acquired. In doing so, Abraham demonstrated a high level of commitment to God and His promises. He demonstrated the ability to listen to God and the faith to allow God to work out the details of His plan.</Text>

            <Synopsis>The introduction of Abram represents a major turning point in the story of Genesis. God’s previous interactions with humanity, from Adam to the Babel event, were marked by discord and conflict. Abram’s responsive acceptance of God contrasted sharply with humanity’s continual resistance (except for Noah; see Gen 6:9–8:22). With Abram, God finally found someone who embraced His offer of blessing in exchange for obedience.

Aside from its use in Gen 12:1, the word occurs eight more times in Genesis. Unfortunately, “birthplace” and “relatives” work equally well in many of the contexts where moledeth occurs. However, in Genesis 12:1 “birthplace” makes more sense than “relatives” since “father’s house” at the end of the list clearly indicates Abram’s extended family

Often caused by drought, famines jeopardized the food supplies of animals and people alike, and they quickly became a matter of life and death. Agriculture in Egypt was less dependent on rain than agriculture in Canaan: The regular flooding of the Nile provided water for crops. During times of famine, people living in Canaan often traveled to Egypt, knowing they would likely find food there. Egyptian tomb carvings from around the 20th century BC such as the Beni Hasan mural show Semitic people traveling to Egypt.

Abram persuaded her to participate in his deception, claiming that he would be killed if she did not. He failed to recognize that because of their ploy, an Egyptian would take her as his wife. Abram’s concern for his own survival blinded him to the issues of Sarai’s purity and protection.

Abram says to Sarai:

  When the Egyptians shall see thee … they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
  Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee (Genesis 12:12–13).

Is this the same man who trusted God, of whom we read, “He was the friend of God,” and “the father of the faithful”? Yes, it is the same man—none other than this same Abram, Abram’s action only proves how deceitful the flesh is, even in the believer, and how we ought to be on guard against it every moment. The Bible knows no such thing as the eradication of the flesh while we are here below. It is still in us to overpower us the moment we are off guard and leave the place of perfect obedience. The saintliest and holiest believer is not immune to the flesh and temptation, but is all too prone to yield and submit to it when it appears that obedience to God may cost him too great a price.

            <Synopsis>Scholars debate the precise identification of Ur of the Chaldeans from which Abram moved. The excavations of Sir Leonard Woolley at Ur in the 1920s and 1930 have led many to assume that the Ur from which Abram departed is the Sumerian Ur, that is, the great city in Lower Mesopotamia located on the Euphrates.

Other scholars have challenged this identification and suggested that Abram’s Ur is to be located in Upper Mesopotamia. Before Sumerian Ur came to light, writers were already equating Abraham’s Ur with Urfa (now called Edessa), which is about twenty miles northwest of Haran. A more recent proposal is to identify the Ur of Gen. 11 with a town called Ura in Hittite territory.

“They came to Haran.” Haran is an ancient and well-known city on the left bank of the Belikh, a tributary of the Euphrates; in cuneiform it is Harrānu(m), often mentioned in the Mari texts. Some scholars think that the name is Hurrian (F. M. T. Böhl and others); later it was karrhä, today once more Harran. The city belonged to the Mitanni empire, then to the Hittite, and afterwards to the Assyrian. The last Assyrian king fled there, and the last Babylonian king, Nabonidus, favored it.
Haran is mentioned in the context of the patriarchal story in Gen. 11:31*, 32*; 12:4*, 5*; 27:43*; 28:10*; 29:4*; in Gen. 24 it is the city of Nahor, Laban, and Rebecca. Such extensive attestation points to the likelihood that it is the place of origin of Abraham’s ancestors.

“Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, 3 and said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.’ 4 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. 5 Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot’s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. 6 And God spoke to this effect—that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. 7 ‘But I will judge the nation that they serve,’ said God, ‘and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.’ 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.

            <Title>Separation from the World</Title>
            <Text>Worldliness can be defined as a love for and a willingness to conform to the sinful values and practices of society. In addition, it can include attachment to the things (good or bad) of this life. Separation from the world means that we desire to know God above all else, seeking to conform one’s life to His ways and living by faith in His promises. In leaving his homeland, he demonstrated separation (or detachment) from the world. The writer of Hebrews argues that Abram was looking for a homeland, but that it was a “better one, a heavenly homeland” (Hebrews 11:13-16). Abraham valued the promises of God over the things he possessed in Mesopotamia or would acquire in his travels. 
Like Abraham, we are called to value the things of God above the temporal things of this life. We are often consumed with physical necessities, but the life of faith demands that we “…seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.”  We often seek to make as much money as we can, but the life of faith demands that we lay up treasures in heaven. Jesus’ interaction with a certain rich man and the subsequent response of his disciples is instructive. This man diligently sought after Jesus to find out what he needed to do to inherit eternal life. This man’s religious zeal was undeniable. From childhood he had dedicated his life to observing the Ten Commandments. However, one thing stood in the way of him obtaining eternal life - attachment to his great possessions. Since he valued material wealth over following Jesus, it was impossible for him to enter the kingdom of God.
By contrast, the twelve disciples (with the exception of Judas Iscariot) left everything to follow Jesus. In Mark 1:16-20 we read that Peter, Andrew, and the sons of Zebedee (James and John) left their occupations and family business to follow Jesus. In return, the Lord promised that they would receive a hundred times (along with persecutions) what they sacrificed in this life and in the “age to come eternal life” (Mark 10:30). Like Abraham, the disciples demonstrated willingness to give up everything in order to live a life of faith under the Lord’s direction. What about us? Are we willing to trust God enough to detach from those things that bring status, influence, privilege, and comfort? Are we willing to embark on the journey of faith and give up the quest to create our own security in this life?

            <Title>Separation from Family and Friends</Title>
            <Text>God’s call to Abraham demanded that he leave his family, but we know from 12:4-5 that he was accompanied by a sizeable caravan that included his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot. How did Sarai respond? Did she question whether he really heard from God? Did his relatives and friends try to persuade to remain in Haran? Did they question Abraham’s mental stability in following a ‘God’ that was foreign to his people? How easy was it for Abraham to leave his extended family and homeland? We don’t know the answers to these questions, but Abraham responded with obedience. Later on in the narrative, we will discover that Abraham remains faithful through the challenges of family strife and doubt. In addition, he will pass the test of supreme love for God by being willing to sacrifice Isaac.
The walk of faith demands supreme love for Jesus who said, “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me” (Matthew 10:37). Our Lord knows that for some, allegiance to himself will lead to family conflict. In such cases, we must not value our attachment to family so highly that we cave under the pressure of persecution. And like Abraham, we must not cherish our families so highly that it prevents us from fulfilling God’s call on our lives.

            <Synopsis>The OT concept of repentance is expressed with two key Hebrew terms: שׁוּב (šûb) and נָחַם (nāḥam). The Hebrew word šûb (“turn”) expresses repentance as turning away from the wrong path, i.e., sinful behavior, and turning back toward God (Hos 3:5). Thus, repentance is an act of reorientation. The term nāḥam (“console”) can have a number of different meanings, including feeling sorrow or remorse; it can thus express the aspect of repentance that involves contrition for wrongdoing (Job 42:6).

            <Title>NT Context - Hebrews</Title>
            <Synopsis>
More specifically, the present verse forms the minor premise of a syllogism:

    they said they were looking for a homeland (v. 14)
    it could not have been their earthly birthplace (v. 15)
    so it must have been a home in heaven (v. 16a).

Moreover, this whole argument is a midrash tied to ξένοι καὶ παρεπίδημοι in → v. 13, and thus ultimately to Abraham’s words in Gn. 23:4, though Jacob is associated with him, perhaps as a second witness, and the language of exile has wider implications. The argument, as Hebrews develops it, has no direct basis in the OT text. Its immediate basis, moreover, is not Abraham’s words themselves, but the conclusion drawn from them in v. 14 that Abraham, and thus by implication the fathers generally, were looking for a homeland (still to be defined). This homeland, the author argues, could not have been Ur because Abraham knew where it was and could have returned there at any time. In fact, not only did he not do so, but he prevented his descendants from doing so

The sinful tendency to conform to the world, to be contrasted with the biblical command to maintain contact with the world while avoiding becoming like the world.

            <Text>The Rich Young Man
17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 19 You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’ ” 20 And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.” 21 And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 22 Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. 
23 And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” 24 And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” 26 And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, “Then who can be saved?” 27 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.” 28 Peter began to say to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.” 29 Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, 30 who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. 31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Mk 10:17–31). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

17–20. The rich man sought to honor Jesus by kneeling before him and addressing him as “Good Teacher.” Jesus’ objection to being called “good” is surprising to many. However, as Lane suggests, “In calling in question the man’s use of ‘good,’ Jesus’ intention is not to pose the question of his own sinlessness or oneness with the Father, but to set in correct perspective the honor of God.” This man undoubtedly viewed himself as “good” and needed to see that “his only hope is an utter reliance upon God, who alone can bestow eternal life.”18
The question, “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” further suggests the trust that this man had in Jesus. In reply to the man’s question, he recalls in summary fashion several of the ten commandments. The rich man had kept the ten commandments from childhood.
21. It is easy to think of the rich man as simply a pawn in Jesus’ teaching game, as if he gave this man the challenge to give his wealth away in order to use his failure as an object lesson. But Mark says that Jesus “loved him.” Jesus saw great potential in the man’s trust in him, desire for salvation, and righteous lifestyle. He wanted the man to be one of his chosen followers.
22. The rich man’s response reveals his sincerity. The first verb Mark uses to describe his reaction can be translated in two ways. The NIV translation, “the man’s face fell” is an attempt to express one meaning of the word στυγνάσας (stygnasas), which is that his appearance indicated he was gloomy or sad. The NRSV “he was shocked” expresses the alternative. In either case the next phrase says that he went away grieving, because he had great wealth. His wealth was the one thing he would not give up to inherit eternal life.
23–25. Jesus used this opportunity to teach his disciples about wealth. It is hard for anyone to enter the kingdom of God. It is especially hard for a rich man. In fact Jesus uses a hyperbolic illustration which characterizes a rich man’s possibilities for entering the kingdom of God as nonexistent. There is no ancient evidence for the oft-cited opinion that the eye of the needle was a gate into the walls of Jerusalem that a camel could enter only with great difficulty.20 Jesus had in mind the eye of a literal needle.
26. The shock expressed by the disciples in vv. 24 and 26 may reveal an underlying theology that supposes that rich men like the one they had just seen are rich because they are blessed by God for their righteousness. Their reaction, “Who then can be saved?” seems to imply that the rich would be especially likely to be saved. If they are not saved, then who can be?
27. Fortunately, impossibilities are possible for God. Rich men can be saved and so can the rest of humanity.
28. Peter’s statement sought credit for doing what Jesus told the rich man to do. The twelve had left everything they had behind and followed Jesus. Peter’s language reflects the responses of Peter and Andrew in 1:18 as “they left their nets and followed him” and of James and John in 1:20 as “they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.” The four fishermen had heeded the call and paid a high price.

29–30. Jesus began his reply to Peter with a commendation of his sacrifice. With his customary “I tell you the truth” he emphasized the truth and significance of his promise. Those who sacrifice houses or family or fields for the sake of Jesus or the gospel will receive one hundred times what they have sacrificed in the present life and in the age to come they will receive eternal life. In a later text Jesus tells the disciples that Christians will suffer great family trials as “brother will betray brother to death and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. All men will hate you because of me …” (13:12–13). This statement fills out both the sense in which many may have to leave family members and the ominous reference to “and with them, persecutions” in the promise of reward. Of course, Jesus’ promise does not involve literal multiplications of new family members or houses or fields. The sense in which one gains new family members may be illuminated by Mark 3:34, “Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.” For the multiple returns on houses and fields one might consult Acts 2:44–45: “All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.”


31. This paradoxical saying is apparently a rebuke of the down side of Peter’s statement. Peter has expressed the “me-first” attitude that keeps coming through in the disciples’ behavior (see 8:33–34, 38; 10:13, 35–37, 41) despite Jesus’ repeated efforts to dispel it. Jesus warns Peter that those who place themselves first will be last and vice versa. This statement is more fully illuminated in Matt 19:27–20:16. There Peter’s attitude is more clearly displayed by the addition of his statement, “What then will there be for us?” (19:27). The paradox of the first and last is followed by the parable of the Workers in the Vineyard and, in 20:16, a repetition of the paradox.

            <Text>To enter the kingdom of God one must submit to God’s rule so that God reigns over every aspect of life.
Disciples must be prepared to give up everything. Peter quickly reminds Jesus that they have done exactly that. Jesus promises that their sacrifice will not be for naught. Those who have left earthly attachments for the sake of the gospel will receive hundredfold rewards—but “with … persecutions” (10:30). In this age, those who become homeless will have a home among those who receive them (see 6:10). Those who surrender families will become part of a greater family not based on biological kinship (3:33–35). Those who leave fields will be given greater fields of mission opportunity (see Matt. 9:37–38). Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 400). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

The point of this story is not to drive home the need for all of Jesus’ followers to sell their possessions.Jesus did not insist that Zacchaeus sell all his goods and give them to the poor before he would deign to eat with him. Zacchaeus voluntarily offers to give up half of his possessions and to restore fourfold whatever he may have gained by fraud (see Ex. 22:1; Lev. 5:16; Num. 5:7). This willingness to make things right evokes Jesus’ response, “Today salvation has come to this house” (Luke 19:8–9). Jesus’ encounter with this rich man in Mark serves to illustrate how difficult it is for the rich (or any one, for that matter) to do this. Few are willing to risk divesting themselves of whatever provides them security in this life to enter a new quality of life under God’s rule. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (pp. 402–403). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

Wealth possesses high voltage and explosive energy since so many crave it and it strikes such reverence in the heart. No Christian is immune from the danger of Mammon. Covetousness is like a virus that takes residence in the soul and begins slowly to work its destruction. The love of acquisition and an appetite for self-gratification will deaden the instinct for self-sacrifice. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 403). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

Jesus said that the rich man in this story lacked one thing, though he did not specify what it was. In applying this passage to our contemporary situation we can imagine that he lacked the very things that we ourselves may lack. First, this man lacked for nothing. He had too much to give up. Money brings people many things (honor, respect, admiration, power, beauty, sex), which is why it is so alluring. Wealth cannot make one holy or purchase eternal life, and it does not offer any deep happiness, even when people get more than their fair share. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 406). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

The second thing this man lacked was trust. God requires something more than simply reverence for Jesus and zealous attempts at obedience. God requires radical trust. Like so many today, this rich man wanted to serve God on his own terms. He obeyed all the commandments that suited him but resisted giving his whole life over to God. He was “afraid to expose himself to the uncertainties and insecurities of the future” or to make himself vulnerable as a child. He accumulated possessions to secure his life in this world, and he accumulated obedience to the commandments to secure his life in the world to come.25 In a culture that has grown wary of commitment and risk, few want to bet their whole lives on Jesus. They also want to keep a material safety net and refuse to disentangle themselves from something that brings status, influence, and privilege. Few are willing to trust that there will be other brothers and sisters in the faith who will watch over them and care for them, partly because we do not watch out for them. To have life, one must trust God and give up the quest to create one’s own security. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 407). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.</Text>

            <Text>37. It is affection that binds households together; thus Jesus moves on to consider the place of love. He assumes that there will be love between parents and children, but claims for himself a higher place in his disciples’ affection than that which they accord to their nearest and dearest on earth, and that in a society that held it a dreadful thing to put anyone higher than one’s parents. 


Loves88 is a significant word; it points to the warmest affection. Jesus does not bid his followers love their parents or their children (nor, on the other hand, does he forbid warm affection in the family). He simply assumes that family members will love one another. But he is concerned that they must not value their attachment to the members of their families so highly that he is pushed into the background. This has important implications for an understanding of the person of Jesus. 


No mere man has the right to claim a love higher than that for parents or children; it is only because he is who he is that Jesus can look for such love. The words imply that he is more than a merely human teacher and leader. Of the one who lacks this love for him he says that he is not worthy of me (GNB, “is not fit to be my disciple”). 


We must not forget that Jesus knew what it was to experience misunderstanding in the family, for his own thought him mad (Mark 3:21). Jesus is not asking from his followers something he did not know for himself.

            <Text>37. Because of the division which Jesus provokes within families (vv. 34–36), true discipleship may bring a conflict of loyalties, and in that case, following Jesus must take precedence over the natural love of family (the Greek word is phileō, natural affection, not agapaō, the loving commitment which is a Christian characteristic). 


The Christian may even have to leave his family (19:29). The Lucan parallel (Luke 14:26) calls for ‘hatred’ of the family, but Matthew’s version correctly interprets this Semitic idiom (cf. Gen. 29:31; Deut. 21:15; Mal. 1:2–3) as an expression of prior loyalty or of choice rather than of actual dislike. Jesus calls not for an unloving attitude, but for a willingness to put him first in the concrete situation where the calls of Jesus and of family conflict. 



For the Rabbis too the claims of the teacher came before those of the father (Mishnah, BM 2:11). For worthy, see on v. 11; ‘not the right sort to be my disciple’.

            <Text>This passage is unique to Luke, though verses 26–27 are like Matthew 10:37–38 and verses 34–35 are similar to Matthew 5:13 and Mark 9:49–50. It is extremely significant that this passage is addressed to large crowds. Jesus offered himself to all, but he also was honest from the very beginning of his preaching about what the journey would involve. What Jesus asks for is first place in one’s heart. That is what successful discipleship requires.

So Jesus calls for a follower who will hate his mother and father, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life. The point of the list is that no other relationship is first for a disciple. “Hate” is used figuratively and suggests a priority of relationship. Jesus is first. To follow Jesus means to follow Jesus, not anyone or anything else. A disciple is a learner, and the primary teacher in life is Jesus. This total loyalty is crucial, given the rejection and persecution that lie ahead. If his followers care more about family than about Jesus, when families are divided under pressure of persecution, they will choose against Jesus. This is what lies behind Jesus’ remarks. Discipleship is not possible if Jesus is not the teacher.

            <Text>God’s threefold promise to Abraham begins with the promise of land (12:1). When Abraham left Haran with Sarah, Lot and all of their possessions, they set out for the land of Canaan (12:5). When they arrived, they discovered that the territory was already inhabited by Canaanites. When Abraham arrived at Shechem the Lord appeared and reassured him - “to your offspring I will give this land” (12:7). The promised land definitely refers to Canaan, also known as Palestine, the land of Israel. In response to God’s reassurance Abraham built an altar and worshiped God. Even though people already inhabited the land, Abraham demonstrated that faith in God’s promise   displays itself through actions. He reminds us that faith begins with hearing God’s word and grows as we continue to receive and obey God’s word. A living faith leads to a life of worship.
As Abraham continued to explore the land and build altars to God, we know that he was also looking forward to an eternal land, for the Scripture says “he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God”. God’s promise to Abraham also included the assurance of an eternal city and homeland that transcended Canaan. He journeyed as a foreigner looking forward to the fulfillment of the same promise given to us as Christians - the promise of a new heavens and a new earth (2 Peter 3:13). We will inherit the promise of a renewed universe if we, like Abraham, respond to God in faithful obedience to Christ (Romans 4:13). Thus, the promised land not only refers to Canaan but it also is a symbol of the holy city, the New Jerusalem, that will come down out of heaven from God (Revelation 21:2).
Just imagine how the fulfillment of the promised land  would affect Abraham’s life. It would mean removal of the obstacles currently in place in Canaan. He would be able to settle down. He could avoid being exposed to different kinds of dangers, threats and attacks upon his family. In a sense, the fulfillment of the promise would bring victory and rest to Abraham. However, Abraham would have to continue to trust God’s word, guidance and protection in the meantime. As Christians, we are commanded to “strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account” (Hebrews 4:11-13).</Text>

            <Text>

God was choosing Abram to bless the whole earth—all the families of the earth—with the promised seed, the Messiah, the Savior of the world. How do we know this? From Scripture: Scripture clearly tells us that this is a reference to the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. This will be seen in a moment. But common logic and reason also tells us that the promised seed is a reference to the Messiah. Just think: this is a blessing so great that it blesses all the families upon earth, all the families who have lived or ever will live. A blessing this great could only refer to the Savior. Only God Himself—through His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ—could do something so great that it would literally bless every single family upon earth throughout all the generations of human history. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 26). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

 As stated above, Scripture tells us exactly what God meant in this promise: this is a direct—very specific—reference to the promised seed, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah and Savior of the world.
1)	Note the Old Testament references.
a)	God gave the promise of the Savior at least three times to Abram.
 (Ge. 12:3).
(Ge. 22:18).
b)	God confirmed the promise of the Savior to Isaac, Abram’s son.
 (Ge. 26:3–4).
c)	God also confirmed the promise of the Savior to Jacob.
(Ge. 28:14). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 26). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Note the New Testament references and interpretation.
a)	The first New Testament reference is Acts 3:25. Peter preached this glorious fact: Jesus Christ fulfilled the covenant given to Abraham and the other godly fathers of history. What covenant? The covenant of the promised seed, the Lord Jesus Christ, who would bless people and turn them away from their wicked ways. Note this clear declaration: Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 26). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ 26 God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.” The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ac 3:24–26). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

	The third New Testament reference is Ga. 3:8. This verse explains a surprising fact: the promise of the promised seed actually contained the gospel. The gospel of Jesus Christ was actually being preached to Abraham when God promised to give him the promised seed. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 27). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

7 Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” 9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 3:7–9). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

The fourth New Testament reference is Ga. 3:16. This verse gives a clear explanation: the promise of the seed is singular, not plural. The promised seed does not refer to many persons, but to one person, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior and Messiah of the world Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 27). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

16 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 3:16). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

Note this also: a person can only become a child of God’s—Abram’s seed (descendant)—and inherit the promise made to Abram, by faith in Christ, by believing and trusting Him. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 27). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

26 for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 3:26–29). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

3 (12:6) Faith—Testing—Pilgrim—Pilgrimage: there was the testing of faith: Abram reached the land, but he could not settle down within it; he had to pass through the land as a pilgrim, for there was opposition there (the Canaanites). Think for a moment: when Abram arrived in Canaan, what was he expecting to find? A land uninhabited and unpossessed, a free land ready to be claimed by the first pioneer to settle within its borders? Or, was Abram expecting the land to be settled and possessed by people? Scripture does not say, but when Abram crossed the border of Canaan, he found a land already inhabited. The Canaanites, a godless nation of people, were already there. Abram faced a formidable enemy if he began to claim the land. He could easily see that he was not going to possess the land within the foreseeable future. All kinds of questions must have flashed across his mind. He must have been gripped with …
•	uncertainty
•	misgivings
•	hesitation
•	questioning
Could it be that he had misread God, that he had made a mistake?
Abram’s faith was tested, sorely tested. The faith of this great pioneer for God was tested to the nth degree. He was in the land, but he could not yet possess it. Opposition and strong forces stood toe to toe against his claim to the promised land. What was he to do?
⇒	Should he return? Should he give up his faith, turn around and go back home to Haran or to Ur of the Chaldees?
⇒	Should he continue to believe God, following after God’s promises, continue to claim the promises of God despite the opposition and the impossible situation that confronted him? Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 33). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


Thought 1. There is a beautiful analogy for the believer in this experience of Abram. Just as Abram reached the promised land but did not yet physically possess it, so the believer reaches the promised land of heaven immediately upon conversion, but does not yet physically possess it.
When a person is saved—when he truly begins to follow after God and His promises—things happen to him in relation to heaven.
(1)	God counts the believer as already in heaven (see note 3—Ep. 2:6). The believer is not physically in heaven, but he is as good as there. God has promised heaven to him, and what God promises always takes place; thus, the believer is counted as being in heaven, as already there. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 34). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— 6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Eph 2:4–7). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

The believer is immediately placed in the heavenly realm or the spiritual realm of life. That is, his mind and thoughts are focused upon heaven and the things of heaven, upon God and His promises. It is God’s Spirit that pulls his mind to spiritual things, that stirs his mind to focus upon heaven and the things of heaven. As stated, the believer is not bodily in heaven, but his mind is to be kept within the realm (upon the things) of heaven. In fact, if he is truly following after God and His promises, he naturally keeps his mind and thoughts upon God and His promises—the Spirit of God stirs him to so focus his mind. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 34). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

The believer’s faith in the promised land of heaven is constantly tested just as Abram’s was. In fact, the believer is never free from enemies who oppose his inheriting the promised land of heaven. Godless foes—death, Satan, and all kinds of trials and temptations—stand against him while he is living within this world. Just like Abram, the believer is to continue trusting God: he is to believe that God will defeat all the enemies of the promised land, including that final enemy, death. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 34). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Just like Abram, the believer is a pilgrim upon earth: he lives upon earth, but he is only traveling and passing through, ever seeking for the promised land of heaven. The believer is a citizen of both earth and heaven (Ph. 3:20–21). Note this: just like Abram …
•	the believer journeys upon earth, but his destination is the promised land
•	this is not the believer’s home; heaven is his home
•	the believer’s mind and thoughts are upon the earth when necessary, but they are mostly upon the promised land of God
•	the believer’s faith and hope are not in this world, but in God and in the land promised by God
Again, the believer is just like Abram: he is a pilgrim upon earth. He lives for the earth, yes, to make it a far better place; but he also lives for heaven, knowing that this earth is only his temporary home. Simply stated, the true believer knows what Abram knew: he is only a pilgrim upon earth; the promised land of heaven is his eternal destiny. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 34–35). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

20 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Php 3:20–21). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

This is what is meant by the pilgrimage of faith. The believer actually lives upon earth, but he believes that in Christ he lives in the promised land of heaven, and he believes that some day he will bodily live there. Thus, the believer lives upon earth as a pilgrim: his life is a pilgrimage of faith. His life, movements, and being—all that he is—are a pilgrimage of faith.
The point is this: when a person believes in God and His promises, he lives for God and His promises. He lives for something far beyond this earth. This earth is not his home, not his destination or resting place. His faith is in God and in the promised land; thus he lives upon earth as a pilgrim. His life upon earth becomes a pilgrimage of faith. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 35). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. 8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord. 9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb. The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ge 12:7–9). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

What was Abram’s response? Abram made the decision for God, to continue following after God and His promises. Note that he built an altar to the Lord who had appeared to him (v. 8). The altar had at least seven purposes (see Deeper Study # 1—Ge. 8:20 for more discussion):
⇒	To offer sacrifices to God, asking forgiveness for unbelief and sins.
⇒	To make a rededication to God, renewing his commitment to God.
⇒	To seek God’s continued presence and guidance.
⇒	To worship the Lord: to worship the very Person who had met his need.
⇒	To acknowledge the Lord, that the Lord alone could fulfill so great a promise, that he was totally dependent upon the Lord.
⇒	To praise the Lord, to praise Him for giving so wonderful a promise.
⇒	To testify to the Lord, to bear witness to the Lord’s glorious goodness in meeting his need and in giving so great a promise. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 36). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Thought 1. James Montgomery Boice states the point well:
I note this sequence: first, Abram arrives in a place; second, God speaks to him; third, he builds an altar.… I think the sequence is to be understood as being repeated, though it is not always spelled out in detail. First, Abram arrived at a place. Second, he recognized God’s presence. Third, he raised an altar as a testimony to God’s claim upon that place and on those who should ever after live there. Abram passed on—to other places and eventually to glory—but the altars remained. They remained as witness to the fact that in this place a child of God once knelt and prayed, proclaimed the gospel of grace, and claimed that spot for God’s glory.
We are called to do that—wherever we are and at all times. We are called to be pilgrims, but that does not mean that we are to pass through this world and leave it untouched. For the master of the heavenly city is master of this world too, and we are ambassadors of His kingdom and are charged with proclaiming His rule, and actually establishing that rule, wherever our pilgrimage takes us. Do you live on this or that street? On this or that block? Then you must build your altar on that street and claim that neighborhood for Jesus. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).
