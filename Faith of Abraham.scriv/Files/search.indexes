            <Text>In less than ten generations after God commanded Noah and his sons to “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (Ge. 9:3, ESV), mankind had rebelled against God’s mandate and decided to build a world order apart from God’s guidance. It was this type of self-determination which lead the first family (Adam and Eve) to sin against God and plunged humanity into a cesspool of violence and immorality (Ge. 6:1-6). Humanity’s state of being and the conditions on earth grieved the Lord. In an act of judgment and mercy, God sent the Great Flood to destroy mankind, but he spared Noah and his family. This time, God’s reaction to mankind’s rebellion culminating at the Tower of Babel consisted of God dividing the world into nations. Through the lineage of Shem, God will initiate the next phase in His plan to crush the head of the Serpent by choosing one man to be his instrument to bless the world - Abraham.
In Genesis 11:27-32, we learn that Abraham’s family originated in Ur of the Chaldeans. Scholars debate the precise identification of Ur, but most accept modern Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq as the location. Lead by his father Terah, Abraham migrated with his family from Ur to Haran after the death of his brother Haran. Both Ur and Haran were ancient centers for the worship of the moon god Sin - we learn from Joshua 24:2 that Abraham’s family worshipped pagan deities. While living in Haran, Terah died and apparently Abraham (then known as Abram)assumed leadership of the clan which included his barren wife Sarai and his nephew Lot. </Text>

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in standard manuscript format with sub-headings inside the chapters.

How To Use This Template
Edit the Title Page document to ensure it contains the correct information.
Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter Subtitle”.
Create a new text document for each sub-section within the chapter folders, giving each the title of the subheading you wish to appear in the text. You can nest text documents for smaller subheadings, like this:
￼
If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface” or “Introduction” if you prefer. If you would rather the foreword come after the table of contents—as is sometimes the case—drag the “Foreword” document and drop it below the “Contents” document.
If you are compiling to the RTF file format or if you have Microsoft Office installed and are compiling to DOC, DOCX, PDF or Print, you can create a table of contents. Before compiling, simply select all the documents you wish to be included in the contents listing (usually this will be the “Foreword”, all chapter folders, and “Endnotes”, but not the nested sub-sections), then go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as ToC. Paste into the “Contents” document below the “Contents” title. The resulting linked text and page number tags will be replaced with the final chapter names and page numbers in the compiled document. You can format the contents however you wish, for example removing the underlines or indenting subsections if you chose to include them. You don’t need to do this every time you compile, just when chapters have been added, deleted, renamed or moved around. (Note to Microsoft Word users: If you export to Word, you may need to generate a print preview in Word to force the page numbers to show up correctly—they may appear as question marks before doing so.) Deselect “Include in compile” for the Contents document in the inspector if you do not want it in your final output.
If you have no footnotes or endnotes in your text, be sure to delete the “Endnotes” document.
“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Compile your manuscript into standard manuscript format by selecting File &gt; Compile. The “Front Matter” folder is already selected for inclusion in the compile Contents pane.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include. You will also need to edit the title prefix in the “Section Layout”.
Hierarchical numbering: If you require hierarchical numbering for sub-sections, choose “Non-Fiction with Sub-Heads (Hierarchical)” from the “Format As” menu in Compile. Alternatively, edit the “Section Layout” for each level in the “Formatting” pane of Compile and add the “&lt;$hn&gt;” (for “hierarchical numbering”) tag to the title prefixes. 
Page header: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings.

Sample Document

            <Synopsis>&quot;Abram's faith was again tested by trial (Gen 13:2­7). While Abram failed the early
tests in Egypt, he acted selflessly later, allowing Lot to choose the best area of land.
The pairing of these two stories develops a fuller picture of Abram's faith journey: He
had both successes and failures when attempting to follow God's will. Together, these
stories teach us that although our faith might not be perfect, God's continued faithful-

            <Text>Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. 2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed” (Gen. 12:1-4).
God’s interactions with Abraham begins not only with a command to leave his family and homeland - but He also commands Abraham to go to a land God would show him. It should be noted that God had not provided Abraham with the details of the promised land. Abraham’s journey is very risky because his is merely pointed in the direction he should go, but given no information about his final destination. We read in Hebrews that “he went out, not knowing where he was going” (11:8b). Following God under these circumstances demanded great faith on Abraham’s part for he was dependent upon God for daily guidance, protection and sustenance. 
Furthermore, God’s promise to provide Abraham with a great nation presented a great challenge to his faith because Sarai was barren! Despite years of failing to produce children, Abraham (and Sarai) did not surrender to unbelief. Instead, they set out on a journey that will test their faith in God’s promises to the limit. Consequently, Abraham actions will have a significant impact upon humanity.</Text>

            <Title>Separation from the Past</Title>
            <Text>It’s most likely that prior to God calling him Abram was an idolater, given what we read in Joshua 24:2 - “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abram and of Nahor; and they served other gods.’” God’s call to Abram necessitated that he disavow any allegiance to the gods of his fathers. The call demanded that he separate himself from idolatry.
Separation from one’s sinful life is generally known as repentance. One key Hebrew word (šûb - “turn”) expresses repentance as turning away from the wrong path, i.e., sinful behavior, and turning back toward God (DiFransico, Lexham Theological Wordbook). The same idea is found in the New Testament with the Greek word metanoeō which means “to change one’s mind”, resulting in an re-orientation of one’s life (Bauer, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 640). Paul’s recognition of the Thessalonians conversion in 1 Thessalonians 1:9-10 highlights the nature of true repentance - “For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.” Just as God commanded Abram to leave his past behind and center his life on God’s promise, Jesus commands his followers leave behind their past way of living to serve him(Mark 1:15; Luke 13:3). 
As we will learn from the life of Abram, repentance is not just a one-time event in the life of the Christian. Though known as the father of the faithful, Abram suffered many faith failures. Each one proved to be a learning experience and over the course of his life Abram’s trust in God grew. As we come to awareness of the sins and vices that hinder and keep us from experiencing the joy of the Christian life, we realize that there exist much room for spiritual growth in our lives. We must resolve, through the power of the Holy Spirit, to eliminate sinful habits and attitudes that prevent us from fully pursuing the life God intends for us to live. On the other hand, we learn to develop and pursue a lifestyle that will bring honor to God. Just as He did with Abram, God will provide us the grace to grow in our faith!</Text>

            <Title>Cornerstone</Title>
            <Text>The account of God’s interactions with Abram begins with a call for Abram to leave his ancestral people and homeland: ‘Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you”’(Gen. 12:1, ESV). Leaving the comfort of home, family, and familiar surroundings can be quite a challenge because such a transition can remove one from the love, care, acceptance, and security of a strong support system - especially in ancient nomadic cultures. 
However, this is exactly what God demanded of Abram. The word “go” is lek-leka in Hebrew, which expresses that Abram is to “determinately dissociate himself” from his current environment (Bruce Waltke, Genesis: A commentary, 205). Hebrews 11:8 makes it clear that Abram forsook his home in obedience to God’s call. He obeyed not even knowing where he was going! He exchanged the known for the unknown, the familiar for the unfamiliar. God called Abram to a new life, but he had to leave his old life behind. Likewise, Christians have been called to a new life of discipleship which involves separation from the past life of sin, separation from the world, and possibly separation from family and friends.

            <Text>Abram looms over Biblical history as the father of the faithful. His journey to this status began at age 75 when God called him leave his people and homeland. Abram willingly left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, along with their belongings and people they acquired. In doing so, Abram demonstrated a high level of commitment to God and His promises. He demonstrated the ability to listen to God and the faith to allow God to work out the details of His plan.</Text>

        <Document ID="58">
            <Title>Cornerstone</Title>
            <Text>God’s promises to Abraham begins with the promise of land (12:1). When Abraham left Haran with Sarai, Lot and all of their possessions, they set out for the land of Canaan (12:5). When they arrived, they discovered that the territory was already inhabited by Canaanites. When Abraham arrived at Shechem the Lord appeared and reassured him - “to your offspring I will give this land” (12:7). The promised land definitely refers to Canaan, also known as Palestine, the land of Israel. In response to God’s reassurance Abraham built an altar and worshiped God. Even though people already inhabited the land, Abraham demonstrated that faith in God’s promise displays itself through actions. He reminds us that faith begins with hearing God’s word and grows as we continue to obey God’s word. A living faith leads to a life of devotion to and worship of God.
As Abraham continued to explore the land and build altars to God, we know that he was also looking forward to an eternal land, for the Scripture says “he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God”. God’s promise to Abraham included the assurance of an eternal city and homeland that transcended Canaan. He journeyed as a foreigner looking forward to the fulfillment of the same promise given to us as Christians - the promise of a new heavens and a new earth (2 Peter 3:13). We will inherit the promise of a renewed universe if we, like Abraham, respond to God in faithful obedience (Romans 4:13). Thus, the promised land not only refers to Canaan but it also is a symbol of the holy city, the New Jerusalem, that will come down out of heaven from God (Revelation 21:2).
Just imagine how the fulfillment of the promised land  would affect Abraham’s life. It would mean removal of the obstacles currently in place in Canaan. He would be able to settle down. He could avoid being exposed to different kinds of dangers, threats and attacks upon his family. In a sense, the fulfillment of the promise would bring victory and rest to Abraham., but it was not fulfilled during his lifetime. In the meantime, Abraham would have to continue to press onward trusting God’s word, guidance, and protection. As Christians, we are commanded to “strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account” (Hebrews 4:11-13).
God also promised to make Abraham’s name great (12:2). Waltke writes “in the ancient Near East, a name was not merely a label but a revelation of character. Thus a great name entails not only fame but high social esteem as a man of superior character” (A Commentary on Genesis, p. 205). God indeed did make Abraham’s name known: Melchizedek, the high priest of God at Salem recognized him as blessed by God (14); the rulers of his day recognized Abraham as a mighty prince (21:22-34; 23:6); and he was known as a prophet (20:7). Furthermore, Abraham’s name is great throughout history as the ancestral father of Jewish and Arab peoples. More importantly, the name of Abraham is synonymous with faith.  
In addition, God promised to bless and make Abraham great so that he would be a blessing to others. In other words, God promised to use Abraham to have positive impact on the world around him and beyond (12:3). As a result of his response to God’s call, Abraham blessed generations of saints with a great example of faith. The NT writers exalt Abraham as the supreme example of what it means to have a faith that God honors (Romans 4; Galatians 3; Hebrews 11:3-10; James 2:18-23). What made Abraham’s faith so great? Was it because he lived a sinless life? No. In fact, Abraham was plagued by many of the same weaknesses and sins as we are. However, Abraham believed God against the odds. He left Haran for the promised land despite not having the details of the plan or of the final destination. He continued to trust God to fulfill his God despite never possessing the land. He believed that he would become the ancestral father of a great nation despite years of unsuccessful attempts to bear children through Sarai. He believed that God would use him to bless the world through the promised Seed - the Savior -  despite his past life of idolatry and paganism.
Thus the greatest blessing to come through Abraham would be Jesus, the promised Seed through whom salvation would be available to all the world. Galatians 3:8-9 says, “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‘In you shall all the nations be blessed.’ So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.” This is the climax of God’s promises to Abraham. God’s plan of redemption begins with Abraham in Canaan. The promised seed will come through the great nation of Abraham’s loins, Israel. This promised seed, Jesus, is God’s one and only Son who gave His life to atone for the sins of the entire world (1 John 2:2). 
However, Jesus triumphed over the grave and after his resurrection He commissioned his followers to “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:19-20). Just as God called Abraham, we have been called by God through the gospel to follow Jesus, the promised Seed. Those who respond to the gospel are heirs to the promises God made to Abraham. In turn, we are to extend this blessings to others through the teaching and preaching of the gospel. </Text>

            <Text>God’s call to leave his country and his family was paired with great promises. What made Abraham’s faith response so remarkable was that his life circumstances would have led most people to reject God’s call. Furthermore, many of the promises were never fully realized during his lifetime. Just as God called Abraham to a difficult journey with great blessings, Jesus calls His people to a similar journey through the Sermon on the Mount. In this sermon, the Lord offer several blessings to potential followers. These blessings include the following:

“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. 
“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:3,5,10)

The Lord’s call to discipleship through the Gospel is a difficult journey for us. The character virtues of humility, meekness, submission to persecution for the sake of righteousness does not appeal to us. However, the promises of finding life in God’s kingdom and inheriting life on the new heavens and earth can only be realized by embarking on this journey. We can experience the blessings offered by Jesus because one man, Abraham, decided to faithfully respond to God’s call thousands of years ago. We have been entrusted with the Gospel message to call all people to follow Christ. This is how we participate in God’s great promise to Abraham that in him all the world will be blessed. As we do so, we have the promise of Christ presence to the end of the age and we can be assured that God will be faithful to His promises.</Text>

            <Text>“Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land” (12:10). After having obeyed God’s call to go to Canaan and receiving reassurance of the promise, Abraham is confronted with a difficult trial of his faith - he finds himself in the midst of a severe famine. The future looks dim in Canaan. This situation presented an issue of life and death to Abraham and his family. He may have asked God at this point, “I thought you were going to make me into a great nation?” Abraham now had to choose between remaining in the land of promise, thus risking starvation or moving on to greener pastures where his family could survive. In Abraham’s day Egypt was a popular destination to escape famine because agriculture in Egypt was more dependent on the regular flooding of the Nile river. So, Abraham decided to take matters into his own hands and moved his family to Egypt. Did his decision represent a lack of faith in God’s ability to fulfill His promises in Canaan? Maybe so. On the other hand, Abraham may have rationalized that a dead man could not father a great nation.
“When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, ‘I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance, and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me, but they will let you live. Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake’” (12:11-13). There is no doubt that now Abraham demonstrates a lack of faith driven by fear and self-preservation. Instead of trusting God to protect him, Abraham made a self-centered decision to engage in deception. We learn from Genesis 20:13 that when God called him to leave his father’s house, Abraham feared losing his life to powerful men in dangerous territories who might be attracted to his beautiful wife. Now that they are about to enter Egypt and face Pharaoh, Abraham convinces Sarah to enact their brother-sister narrative so that he might receive a bride price from interested suitors. 
Does this sound like the same man who demonstrated great faith by leaving family, friends, and homeland in pursuit of a promise he has not seen? Is this the same man who displayed great devotion to God by building altars of worship to the one true God in pagan lands? Here we see that Abraham, known as the friend of God and father of the faithful, struggled with sin and fear as we do today. The Scriptures provide plenty examples of God’s faithful succumbing to sin: Noah and his drunkenness; David and Bathsheba; and Peter’s denial of the Lord. Abraham’s actions shows how deceitful sin is and that we all need to be watchful and vigilant in prayer because the flesh will never be completely  done away with in this life. We all should keep in mind the admonition “therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall” (1 Corinthians 10:12).
“When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels” (12:14-16). Abraham’s fears become realized. Sarah’s beauty has captured the attention of Pharaoh’s princes and consequently she ends up in Pharaoh’s house! In exchange, Abraham is living the high life as he receives animals and servants. What might Sarah be thinking and feeling at this point? Anger? Abandonment? Disappointment? We don’t know Sarah’s state of mind at this point but Abraham’s decision jeopardized her, their marriage, and the fulfillment of God’s promises in their lives. His actions reminds us that we often allow circumstances rather than God’s word to drive our behavior. Just as Abraham, we make decisions which negatively impact our loved ones and distract us from pursuing God’s will. However, as the narrative proceeds, we discover that by God’s grace and mercy we can get back on track. God is willing and able to guide us back to pursuing His will. 
“But the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. So Pharaoh called Abram and said, ‘What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.’ And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had” (12:17-20). Abraham had gotten himself and Sarah into a mess, but God did not give up on him. God did not say, “Abraham, since you made such a foolish, fearful decision you’re disqualified from inheriting my promises. I’m going to call someone else to do what you couldn’t!” Instead, God made it known to Pharaoh  that Sarah was another man’s wife! God delivered Sarah from what appeared to be a hopeless situation. God remained faithful to His promises even though Abraham was temporarily unfaithful. What a great God we serve! This episode bears witness to the truth that God “does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities” (Psalm 103:10). Though Abraham was a great man of faith, he did not merit the promises of God.
After Pharaoh became aware of Sarah’s marital status, he returned her to Abraham and sent them away from Egypt with more possessions than they arrived with. One of those possessions made have included Hagar, Sarah’s personal maid servant. If so, we see that though God shows us mercy and grace through our sins and failures, our choices have enduring consequences. As we live with the ongoing effects of our sinful choices we often struggle with  self-condemnation. However, as with Abraham, we must remind ourselves that God is committed to completing His work of transformation within us until the return of Jesus Christ (Philippians 1:6). 
Furthermore, God can use our failures and sins to teach us valuable lessons in order to prevent us from making more tragic decisions in the future. We learn from this episode that the flesh is at war against the Spirit within us and if we let down our guard the old nature will overpower  our best intentions. Satan, the enemy of our souls, seeks our ultimate destruction; therefore, we ought to be vigilant every moment of our lives. The apostle Peter puts it this way: “Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so That at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. Be sober-minded, be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:6-8).

            <Text>Though Abraham was a man of great faith, we read that he had ‘feet of clay’ just as we do. When confronted with a dire situation and an encounter with the powerful Egyptians, Abraham resorted to deception because he doubted God’s willingness and ability to deliver him. Abraham focused on the circumstances and allowed fear to drive his decisions rather than faith. This reminds us of the apostle Peter’s experience of walking on water. When he began to focus on the windstorm rather than Jesus, he became afraid and began to sink. The Lord gracefully delivered Peter from drowning just as God delivered Sarah from the clutches of Pharaoh. God provides the same grace to His children today.
The antidote to fear of man and situations is focus on the power and goodness of the Lord. The apostle Paul wrote, “and we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28). We serve a God who uses the good and bad to accomplish His plans for His people. No matter how dire the situation, how the big the obstacles, or how overwhelming the odds may seem God will protect and guide His people by His providential power.</Text>

            <Text>“So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.” After a temporary lapse of faith in Egypt on Abraham’s part, God delivered Sarah from the hands of the Egyptians. Abraham traveled south through the Negeb back to the area between Bethel and Ai, the place he originally settled after leaving Haran. God has blessed Abraham through his recent episode - he is now “very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold”, indicating that Abraham left Egypt more wealthy than when he arrived. However, riches (nor failure) did not cause him to forget God for the passage reads “and there Abram called upon the name of the Lord” (13:4). Abraham had repented of the sin he had committed in Egypt and consequently, God had forgiven and blessed him. As Christians, when we turn from our sins and sincerely call upon the Lord to forgive us, we experience restoration of sweet fellowship with God. In addition, God can use us in greater service than before. As we will discover in the case of Abraham relationship with his nephew Lot, such blessings do not eliminate trials from our lives. </Text>

            <Text>“And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents” (13:5). Lot was the son of Abraham’s brother, Haran. Obviously the two shared a close bond, for Abraham took Lot under his wings after the death of Haran. He accompanied Abraham when God called him to leave his homeland. As a result of his association with Abraham, Lot prospered and grew wealthy to the point that the land they lived in could not support both their livestock (13:6). Oftentimes we think that more money and wealth will eliminate the problems of our lives, but here we see the opposite - it created more problems and tension! Verse 7 says “and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.” Increased blessings led to disputing between the herdsmen of Abraham and Lot due to the lack of land resources. This trial presented another test of Abraham’s faith. How will he deal with the conflict amongst his own family caravan? Will he be passive and allow it to boil to the point of severe conflict? Whatever course of action he would decide upon, the native peoples of the land (the Canaanites and Perizzites) would be witnessing the outcome of the situation. Whenever conflicts arise among Christians, we should view such trials as opportunities to bear strong witness for God to a watching world. 
Notice Abraham’s loving response - “Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen” (13:8). Abraham demonstrates love for Lot by expressing his desire to keep peace between their workers. He doesn’t want the conflict to escalate to the point of more strife because he values Lot’s relationship. It should be remembered that Abraham and Sarah have not conceived children, so most likely he views and loves Lot as a son. Furthermore, Lot had demonstrated great loyalty  in joining Abraham as he followed God and sought the promised land. They would have needed to stick together as they faced great dangers and enemies. Therefore, Abraham sought peace to maintain a good relationship with Lot. Whenever we experience conflicts in our relationships, whether they be in the home, church or at work, we should remember the admonition of Paul to “pursue what makes for peace and for mutual up-building” (Romans 14:19).
What made Abraham’s response even more remarkable is that he gave Lot the option to choose whatever area he wanted to settle (13:9)! Instead of fighting for his rights to the land because he was the head of the family, the leader, and the person to whom God had promised the land, Abraham demonstrated great humility, generosity and faith in giving up his claim to choose first! Abraham shows what is means to “do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves” (Php. 2:3). As Christians, we are to relinquish our rights to choose first in order to enrich others. Abraham was able to do this because he firmly believed God’s promise to ultimately give him the land. When we are focused on God promises and secured in Christ, we become less concerned about accumulating money and possessions. When we are willing to seek God and His righteousness above all else, we are able live selflessly because we know that God will meet all of our needs. 
Did Lot return the favor by declining first choice to the land? No. In contrast to Abraham, he jumped at the opportunity to enrich himself: “And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar” (13:10a). Just as Eve was attracted by the fruit of the forbidden tree (Genesis 3:6), Lot is attracted what he sees in the Jordan Valley where the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were located. Instead of trusting God and walking by faith, Lot chooses to walk by selfishness and greed. Even though Abraham had demonstrated great love for Lot by rearing him, educating him and contributing blessings to him, Lot chose what he thought was the best thing for himself. Sooner and later, Lot’s choices will prove to be unwise and disastrous for him and all those with him. When we are misled by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (as Lot was), we make similar decisions filled with negative spiritual impact. Therefore, we must make decisions such as where to live and work, who to date and marry, and what to entertain ourselves with in light of God’s will. That’s why it is important to “not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect” (Romans 12:2).
After Lot separated from him and settled near the wicked men of Sodom, God reaffirmed his promises to Abraham. Lot had selfishly lifted up his eyes and choose land that seemed best for himself settle, but God instructed Abraham, “lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever” (13:14-15). What irony! In a situation in which Abraham seemed to have gotten a raw deal, God lets him know that this is only a temporary setback! God’s sovereign will is to give the entire land (including what Lot chose for himself) to Abraham and his descendants to possess forever. Through this entire ordeal, Abraham lifted up his eyes in humility and selflessness. Through this entire trial, Abraham lifted up his eyes to God in faith and trust. And now God has reaffirmed his covenant with Abraham, letting him know that the current state of affairs will not last forever. 
Abraham’s exemplary faith in this situation reminds us of the Beatitude, “blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth” (Matt. 5:5). Meekness should not be equated with weakness. We should remember that Abraham was by no means inferior to Lot, for he was a highly skilled military leader who could have easily dominated the situation. By example, he teaches us to be humble, dependent on God, and willing to look not only to our own interests, but also to the interests of others (Php. 2:4). Our Lord Jesus put forth the supreme example of selflessness who “though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich” (2 Corinthians 8:9)
Abraham also teaches us that the proper response to God’s grace is a life of worship. After the Lord reaffirmed his promises, “Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord” (12:18). As Abraham continued on his journey of faith in Canaan, he worshiped and left witness that the true and living God had promised him the land. On our journey of faith, we are to present ourselves as living sacrifices holy and acceptable to God, which is our spiritual worship (Romans 12:1). In doing so, we bear witness to the mercies of God.

            <Text>This episode in Abraham’s life demonstrates that for us faithful living involves both failure and success. Though Abraham failed miserably under cowardice in Egypt, he responded peacefully through humility and meekness to the conflict that threaten his and Lot’s relationship. In a magnanimous act, Abraham trusted God to provide in letting Lot choose what appears to be the best land to support his livestock. By contrast, Lot makes a decision that takes him away from godly influence and puts himself in dire circumstances. Consequently, God reaffirms his promise to Abram to give him all the land and to make him a great nation. In a sense, Abraham points us to our Lord Jesus who humbled himself to crucifixion on the cross and then is highly exalted by God above every creature in heaven and on earth (Php. 2:9-11). May we keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and seek to live, through the power of the Spirit, as selflessly as he. </Text>

            <Text>Genesis 14 provides the account of how Lot and his people became prisoners of war. Driven by worldliness, Lot forfeited the divine protection he enjoyed as part of Abraham’s caravan and gets captured by an invading army, which leads to Abraham’s involvement in the military conflict. We learn that Lot has embedded himself deeply into the wicked culture of Sodom. At first, he chose to camp near Sodom (13:12) but over time he took up residence within the city (14:12). Consequently, Lot will lose his family, property, livestock and wealth. What appeared to be a good decision according to worldly standards will lead to Lot being captured and deported to serve as a slave to the invaders.
The occasion of Lot’s capture is a war that occurred between two groups of allied kings. Five kings of city-states in Palestine (including Sodom and Gomorrah) revolted against the rule of Chedorlaomer, who had conquered them twelve years prior and collected tribute (taxes) since that time. In response, Chedorlaomer allied himself with three other kings to invade and reassert his rule in Palestine. They swept the entire region around the Dead Sea, recapturing many cities along the way until they ended up the Valley of the Dead Sea near Sodom and Gomorrah. Apparently, the five Palestinian kings went out to battle with superior numbers but were nevertheless defeated in the valley. In fact they suffered such humiliation that the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled as many of their warriors fell into the bitumen (pitch/tar) pits that filled the valley. Chedorlaomer and his forces looted Sodom and Gomorrah, capturing Lot in the process.
News of this event reached Abraham, but how would he react? Lot had separated from Abraham in selfish pursuit of the best land for his livestock, leaving Abraham to fend for himself. Would Abraham leave Lot to his just desserts? Would Abraham allow resentment and bitterness to guide his behavior? Would he rationalize that Lot has received God’s judgment for relocating to wicked Sodom? Would he say to himself, “he made his own bed, let him lie in it!” The answer is no. Instead, Abraham will refuse to allow Lot’s worldliness to prevent him to act with courage and compassion. Even though Lot demonstrated that he is looking out for number one, Abraham will exhibit love and loyalty by risking his life, family, and fortune to save him. </Text>

            <Text>“Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram” (14:13). Here, Abraham is known as ‘the Hebrew’, an ethnic term connected with Eber (Waltke, p.231). Eber was the last ancestor in the genealogy of Shem before God disrupted the building of the tower of Babel (10:21-25). Abraham is a legitimate descendant of Shem, which distinguishes him from the other residents of Canaan. 
Abraham had formed an alliance with Mamre the Amorite and his two brothers prior to the defeat of Sodom and the capture of Lot. Apparently, Abraham wisely anticipated the need to ally himself with reliable men who would join him to combat unseen dangers and opposition. He bore witness to the truth of the proverb that says “ And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him — a threefold cord is not quickly broken” (Ecclesiastes 4:12). We should follow Abraham’s example by forming strong relationships with other Christians within the local congregation so that we can have strong spiritual support when facing struggles and opposition. In doing so we fulfill the command to “bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ” (Galatians 6:2). Our faith journey is filled with burdens which God does not intend for us to carry alone. Therefore, it is important that we form relationships with other Christians in which we support one another. 
“When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan” (14:14). After receiving the report, he organizes a military mission with 318 of his most trusted, trained men to rescue Lot from captivity. In contrast to his actions in Egypt where he allowed fear to rule him, here Abraham displays great courage and faith.  When faced with opposition to our faith or with challenging situations that threaten in some way, we’re often tempted to give in to fear. However, just as Abraham trusted that God’s promises to make him a great nation would guarantee military victory, we must trust that God’s promises to protect us guarantees our ultimate victory over all opposition. One such promise can be found in Hebrews 13:5b-6: “for he has said, ‘I will never leave you nor forsake you.’ So we can confidently say, ‘The Lord is my helper; I will not fear; what can man do to me?’”. 
Abraham’s mission to rescue Lot ended with the defeat of the enemies. Verse 16 says, “then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people.” Despite the formidable opposition he faced, Abraham had successfully organized and executed a mission to save Lot and the people with him. We should note that Abraham could have made several excuses not to save Lot: 1) Lot had acted selfishly in taking the best land for himself; 2) Lot was worldly and deserving of the circumstances he fell into or 3) Lot’s captors were strong and formidable. Instead, Abraham refused to let Lot remain enslaved to his captors. Oftentimes we adopt a negative attitude towards our fellow Christians who ‘mess up’ their lives through poor decisions. We must remember that Scripture teaches us that whenever a fellow Christian “is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness” (Galatians 6:1). Whenever we see a fellow Christian enslaved or ensnared in sin, we are to act with courage and love to do all we can to free them. This requires the humility to recognize that we all are susceptible to sins such as immorality, drunkenness, drugs, gluttony, lust, worldly ambition, etc. Keeping in mind that Christ died for us while we were sinners (and his enemies!) should help us to adopt the proper attitude we need in such situations. 
Through this event, God is fulfilling His promise to make Abraham’s name great (Genesis 12:2). Melchizedek, the king of Salem and priest of God, recognized this and hosted a royal banquet declaring Abraham as blessed and protected by “God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth” (Genesis 14:19-20a). In the presence of thousands of Canaanites who had just been freed, Melchizedek praised God as the One behind Abraham’s success! By God’s power, Abraham had just brought stability and peace to the land of Canaan, thus being an instrument of God’s blessing to others. So, this occasion served as an excellent opportunity to bear witness to the one true God! In Matthew 5:16 Jesus commanded “In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” As we live out our faith other people will notice. When that happens, we should use such opportunities to direct their attention to God.
In response to Melchizedek’s recognition, Abraham gave him a tenth of the possessions he gained in the victory (Genesis 14:20b). This is the first explicit reference in Scripture to what will become known as the ‘tithe’. In giving him a tenth of everthing, Abraham recognized Melchizedek as the legitimate priest and king of his God (Waltke, p. 235). On the other hand, when the king of Sodom approached him with a proposal to share the spoils of war, Abraham responded “I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich’” (Genesis 14:22b-23). Evidently, the wicked king had ulterior motives behind his proposal which would had indebted Abraham in the eyes of the Canaanites. Abraham refuses to compromise and gives all the possessions he acquired to his allies Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. In doing so, Abraham expresses his complete dependence upon God to supply his needs. Let us remember that God richly provides for all of our needs “according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:19).</Text>

            <Text>In Genesis 14, we see a confident and decisive Abraham who showed great faith in God’s presence and protection.  Consequently, he brought blessing to a great number of people and glory to God in the process. This stands in contrast to what happened in Egypt, where his actions brought affliction upon the household of Pharaoh. However, God continued to be faithful to His promises and mightily used Abraham to overcome great obstacles as he rescued Lot. Abraham’s example shows us that God can accomplish great things in our lives despite our past sins, failures, and ever-present weaknesses. The apostle Paul pleaded with God to remove a thorn from his life, but the thorn served the purpose of keeping him humble. At Paul’s lowest point of desperation, the Lord spoke to him “my grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9). As we rebound from falling in our walk of faith, let us depend upon God’s grace to accomplish His purpose for our lives. Let us show corrective compassion toward our fellow Christians who mess up while remaining aware of the deceitfulness of sin. Let us live above reproach in seeking to do all things to the glory of God. </Text>

            <Text>In Genesis 14, Abraham demonstrated great faith in God in saving Lot and defeating a powerful Mesopotamian alliance lead by Chedorlaomer. God’s promise to make Abraham’s great is fulfilled at the great banquet hosted by God’s high priest, Melchizedek. Refusing to compromise with the king of Sodom, Abraham demonstrated appreciation to his own alliance by giving them the spoils of the victory. Things seem to be looking up for Abraham.
However, Abraham (and Sarah) have yet to give birth to a biological son through whom he would become a great nation. Years had passed since the initial call to leave his homeland and now Abraham was beginning to wonder if God intended to bless him with a son through Sarah. Like Abraham, we often experience a certain level of doubt when circumstances and events call into question God’s goodness or love. Oftentimes, personal struggles lead to question God’s ability to transform us to be more like Christ. At other times, our emotions seem to be a better indicator of reality rather than the truth of God’s words.  
We will discover in Genesis 15 that God doesn’t abandon us during seasons of doubt. Rather, God provides the assurances we need to continue to walk by faith. </Text>

Just as God protected His faitful warrior Abraham, we “by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time” (1 Peter 1:5). Second, God reveals himself as the ‘LORD GOD’, the one who is sovereign over history. He has all power and authority to govern who possesses the land of Canaan at any given time. Third, just as God revealed the specifics of His promises to Abraham in progressive stages to sustain his faith, God gives us what we need at the appropriate time in our spiritual journeys. Fourth, God will remain faithful to His word despite our failures and weaknesses. As we encounter the struggles of life, we should not let our feelings overrule the need to allow the truth of God’s words to guide our thinking. </Text>

            <Text>The events in Genesis 16 illustrates what often happens when God’s timing does not meet our expectations. God had appeared to Abram in a powerful way to reaffirm His promises and to establish a covenant with Abram. The Lord provided specific territorial details and a time line for the fulfillment of the land promise. However, after having lived in Canaan for 10 years, Abram and Sarah remained childless. Consequently, Sarah grew restless, got tired of waiting for the promised seed and initiated a plan to shorten the delay. Unfortunately, the implementation of her plan will create much domestic strife. 
Sarah’s state of barrenness created much emotional distress for her. In Bible times, both OT and NT, to be a wife without bearing children was regarded as a matter of regret and social disgrace (Meiklejohn, p.123). It was also considered a curse from God, as will become evident in Sarah’s demand of Abram to produce a child through Hagar, her maid servant (Genesis 16:2). At this point in the narrative, Sarah’s back is flat against the wall. She’s getting no younger and the situation is dire. So, we can fully empathize with the reasoning “Doesn’t God help those who help themselves? I’ve got to have a child now while I can!” More often than not, this type of reasoning leads us to become impatient with God’s timing and will, thus creating painful consequences.

            <Text>This episode in the life of Abraham, Sarah and Hagar reveals to us many things and challenges us in several ways. For one, God cares for those who have been victimized and rejected. Abraham and Sarah used Hagar outside of God’s will and pushed her away, but God sought her out in the middle of the desert. As God’s people, we should imitate God by seeking to show His love to those who live on the fringe of society.
Also, God’s plans and promises are not derailed by our sins and failures. Abraham and Sarah made a bad decision that proved to have far-reaching effects. Ishmael will display a strong independent spirit and will give rise to people who live in fierce opposition to their neighbors. However, the multiplication of Ishmael’s descendants fulfills God’s original promise make Abraham’s offspring to be as the number of stars in the sky (Genesis 15:5). God will also remain faithful to His covenant to make Abraham a great nation through Sarah. 
We must remember that the desires of the flesh, which wars against what God desires for us, often manifest itself in the form of impatience. In addition, those closest to us can become the sources of temptation to lead us down the wrong path. Sarah may have had good intentions in giving Hagar to Abraham, but her impatience led to unnecessary complications for their family. When we attempt to take control to try to achieve God’s blessings and purposes outside of His will, we should expect negative effects. 
Waiting on God is not something most do well, but we must seek to be “imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises” (Hebrews 6:12b). When we find ourselves in prolonged periods of distress, loneliness, or struggle, discontentment can easily become a way of life. The life of faith requires that we accept God’s timing for change and/or deliverance. If we don’t find escape from the troubles we experience, God will provide the strength we need to survive. Living by faith in God does not mean our lives will be filled with ease and comfort. However, we must trust that God sees and pays attention to us through all the seasons of life. Just as God worked in the life of Hagar, God continues to be present with us through our difficulties. We may only can see just far enough to make the next step, but that step should only be taken as we live in fellowship with God, listen to His voice through His word, and keep the pathway of prayer open.

            <Text>Thirteen years prior to the events in Genesis 17, Sarai gave Hagar as a concubine to Abram to bear children. In doing so, she displayed impatience with God’s promise and started a cycle of conflict which shook Abram’s household. Hagar ends up fleeing from Sarai but does not reach her final destination because she encounters the angel of the Lord who comforts her with God’s promise and commands her to return to Sarai. Hagar gave birth to Ishmael when Abram was 86 years old, but the child is not given to Sarai. Sarah’s ill-advised plan to build a family apart from God’s promise failed and proved true the proverb “many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand” (Proverbs 19:21).
Abram is now ninety-years old, Sarai eighty-nine, and it appears that God’s promise to provide the couple with a child will not be fulfilled since both are well beyond childbearing age. Ishmael is now entering manhood and Abram had probably resigned to believe that he was bound to be the son of promise. During the years of divine silence Abram had raised Ishmael, developed a deep bond with him, and had probably become content and comfortable with the way life unfolded so far. Like Abram, we can become comfortable with the way things are going. We can fall victim to complacency and subsequently forget the promises and calling of God upon our lives. Genesis 17 shows us how God aroused Abram from such a state of comfort. </Text>

            <Text>Abraham led his whole household to obey and to enter into a covenant relationship with God by following His instructions for circumcision (Genesis 15:22). Though it seemed incredulous that God would fulfill His seed promise through Sarah, Abraham accepted and surrendered to God’s will and purpose. We must be willing to do the same today. The church needs men and women to be willing to obey God’s word without question and at all costs. We all experience moments of temporary doubt concerning the willingness and power of God to deliver, His promises, the nature of His will and our place in it. We don’t see how God can or will pull us through situations such as financial hardship or relational conflict. That puts us in the same company with Abraham and Sarah. However, we must remember that our Lord is full of grace and that He will remain faithful to us through our weaknesses, limitations, and faults. He supplies the spiritual strength we need to live by faith, far more than we can ask for or imagine (Ephesians 3:20). He is committed to fulfilling His promises to us and will bring to completion His work of transformation in us at the day of our Lord Jesus (Philippians 1:6). </Text>

            <Text>A manifestation in which God’s presence is made visible and recognizable  is called theophany (an appearance of God). Thus far we have seen that God communicated with and appeared to Abraham in various  ways (12:1-3; 12:7; 13:14; 15:1; 17:1). In Genesis 17 God appeared to 99-year old Abram to reaffirm His promises and covenant with Abram and his descendants. In doing so, God gave Abram and Sarai new names and identities reflective of their roles in God’s plan, established circumcision as the sign of the covenant, and told Abraham that Sarah would give birth to a son within one year. Abraham laughed at God’s plans for Sarah and asks God to make Ishmael the covenant heir. God promised to bless Ishmael but Isaac would be the elect son through whom God’s covenant will continue. Abraham faithfully accepted God’s plan by responding in obedience to God’s command to circumcise all the male members of his household.
In Genesis 18, a special theophany occurs. The Lord and two angels  visit Abraham in human form. Abraham will show himself to be a man of great hospitality during their visit. The Lord will reiterate that Sarah will bear a son within a year’s time, but we will learn that Sarah had a hard time believing the Lord. Like we do today, the heroes and heroines of faith sometimes found it difficult to acknowledge that God’s power could transform their lives. In addition, the Lord will reveal to Abraham His impending judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah which will prompt Abraham to intercede for the cities’ pardon.

            <Text>Genesis 18 presents an intimate picture of the relationship between the Lord and Abraham. This picture is a symbol of the relationship Jesus desires to have with every believer: “Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me” (Revelation 3:20). In a day and age when spiritual lukewarmness seems to be the norm, the Lord’s invitation is for us to renew ourselves in a close relationship with Him. Such a renewal begins with a commitment to pay attention to and obey the teachings of Christ given in Scripture. We must recapture the zeal and delight we had for God’s word when we were first converted to Christ. By the power of the Spirit, we must examine our lives by the truth of God’s word and allow His word transform our minds. In doing so, we grow in our ability to discern and live according to God’s will. Friends of Christ are characterized by obedient fellowship with Christ (John 15:14).
In this text we also see Abraham’s compassion and high concern for justice. He didn’t want to destiny of righteous people to be tied to the wicked ones in Sodom. Consequently, he humbly appealed to God’s just nature to withhold judgment for the sake of the righteous.  Due to his intimate knowledge of God’s mercy and righteousness, Abraham was in a position to negotiate with the Lord. If we want to be in a similar position, we must commit ourselves to abide in Christ or to “seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness” (Matt 6:33). Once we are properly related to the Lord, we should not refrain from asking, seeking, and knocking in prayer.</Text>

            <Text>Finally, the day has come! The birth of Isaac in Genesis 21 was the culmination of God’s promise to Abraham originally given in ch. 12, where the Lord promised to make the patriarch into a great nation. The Lord visited Sarah one year earlier to announce Isaac’s birth, but she laughed in unbelief. Now God will have the last laugh because he intervened to deliver Sarah from a hopeless situation - infertility. God intervenes at the right time to shape history and fulfill His purposes. Sometimes He does this for judgment, as He did in the case of Sodom and Gomorrah, but now He does so for the sake of salvation.
Abraham was seventy-five years old when he left his homeland. Why would God delay Isaac’s birth twenty-five years after His initial call of Abraham? Why wait until Abraham and Sarah were well beyond childbearing years? Throughout the waiting process, the couple experienced several tests of their faith which resulted in successes and failures. Over the long haul they proved themselves to be faithful. We all experience tests of our faith that require us to trust God’s provisions. How will we respond? Will we allow circumstances to fill us with fear and doubt? Or, will we live by God’s word even when we find ourselves in a long season of barrenness?

            <Text>The conflict between Hagar and Sarah makes it’s way into the NT as an allegory (Galatians 4:21-32). Hagar, identified with Sinai, represents the Law given to Moses. Anyone who attempts to be justified before God on the basis law-keeping or good works are offspring of the slave woman Hagar. The Law was given for a limited period in order to make us realize how much we needed a Savior. Those who accept God’s offer of salvation in Christ through faith are the children of the free woman, offspring of the promise. According to Scripture, everyone regardless of biological lineage, has the opportunity to be a spiritual child of Abraham: “for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:27-28).
In the birth of Isaac we see that God is ever true to His word. The foundation of the Christian life is the faithfulness of God. This foundation enables us to “hold fast to the confession of our hope without wavering” (Hebrews 10:23). Though we may struggle with personal weakness, stumble over obstacles, and stray onto the wrong path God can weave the tangled threads of our lives into His sovereign purposes. He has given us the Scriptures to provide us wisdom and guidance to face the problems and crises of life. In addition, we must remember that the future lies in God’s all-powerful hands and that we “by God’s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time” (1 Peter 1:5).</Text>

            <Text>Throughout his life, Abraham faced many tests of his faith with mixed results. The first one consisted of God calling him to leave his relatives and homeland for a land God had yet to show him. When he arrived in Canaan, a famine arose that forced Abraham to go to Egypt where he faced the danger of loosing his life and wife to Pharaoh. Thereafter, a great conflict arose between Abraham’s and Lot’s herdsmen that forced a separation between the two camps, with Lot choosing more fertile territory to dwell in. As the years of Sarah’s infertility lengthened, the delay tested the couple’s resolve to wait on God’s promise of an heir. Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to be a surrogate mother, which led to the conception and birth of Ishmael. After the birth of his promised son Isaac, Abraham was again tested when Sarah demanded that Hagar and Ishmael be cast out of their household. In Genesis 22, Abraham’s faith will meet its greatest challenge.

            <Text>“After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, ‘Abraham!’ And he said, ‘Here I am.’  He said, ‘Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you’” (Genesis 22:1-2).
Here, Abraham received the greatest test of his life: God commanded him to sacrifice his son, Isaac! This had to create a great crisis within Abraham’s soul. He and Sarah had waited years for the fulfillment of the promise. In addition, he had already lost his first son Ishmael. Now the Lord was commanding Abraham to put to death the most precious person in his life. Giving up the choice of best land to Lot was one thing. Sacrificing Isaac and extinguishing the hope of the promise was quite another!</Text>

            <Text>In many ways, the near-sacrifice of Isaac foreshadowed the actual sacrifice of God’s Son, Jesus. Because Abraham loved God, he was willing to sacrifice Isaac; because God so loved the world, He sacrificed His Son so that we might have eternal life (John 3:16). Abraham believed that God could resurrect Isaac; God did resurrect His Son “from the dead and seated him at His right hand in the heavenly places” (Ephesians 3:20). In Isaac, we see no evidence of a struggle against Abraham; our Lord Jesus “humbled himself by becoming obedient of death, even death on a cross” (Philippians 2:8). God provided a ram as a substitute for Isaac; Jesus is “the lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world” (John 1:29). Because of his willingness, Abraham received great reassurance and joy of the Lord’s commitment to His covenant; Jesus “for the joy that was set before him endured the cross” (Hebrews 12:2). 
The book of James uses Abraham’s actions to explain that true faith in God displays itself in active obedience (James 2:21-23). Following God cannot be limited to lip service or head knowledge. Following God requires commitment to trust Him at every turn of life. The journey of faith is filled with difficulties that test our resolve and fill our minds with questions of God’s power and goodness. When we encounter such hardships we should look to the example of Abraham. Through times of doubt, conflict, and personal failure God remained with and strengthened Abraham. On the other hand, Abraham lived in close fellowship with the Lord. He remained open to the Lord’s guidance and responded to His continual calls to obedience. Consequently, Abraham learned more about the character of the Lord. His devotion to the Lord grew to the point of supreme faith in God and His promises. The record of Abraham’s life of faith was given to us for our benefit, “for whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope” (1 Corinthians 15:4).

God’s previous interactions with humanity, from Adam to the Babel event, were marked by discord and conflict. Abram’s responsive acceptance of God contrasted sharply with humanity’s continual resistance (except for Noah; see Gen 6:9–8:22). With Abram, God finally found someone who embraced His offer of blessing in exchange for obedience.

Aside from its use in Gen 12:1, the word occurs eight more times in Genesis. Unfortunately, “birthplace” and “relatives” work equally well in many of the contexts where moledeth occurs. However, in Genesis 12:1 “birthplace” makes more sense than “relatives” since “father’s house” at the end of the list clearly indicates Abram’s extended family

Often caused by drought, famines jeopardized the food supplies of animals and people alike, and they quickly became a matter of life and death. Agriculture in Egypt was less dependent on rain than agriculture in Canaan: The regular flooding of the Nile provided water for crops. During times of famine, people living in Canaan often traveled to Egypt, knowing they would likely find food there. Egyptian tomb carvings from around the 20th century BC such as the Beni Hasan mural show Semitic people traveling to Egypt.

            <Synopsis>On some level, Abram’s lack of faith was driven by the overwhelming instinct of self-preservation: He didn’t want to die. This also manifested as a lack of concern for Sarai. Abram persuaded her to participate in his deception, claiming that he would be killed if she did not. He failed to recognize that because of their ploy, an Egyptian would take her as his wife. Abram’s concern for his own survival blinded him to the issues of Sarai’s purity and protection.

            <Synopsis>On another level, though, Abram’s actions can be understood as an attempt to preserve the future promised in Gen 12:2–3. In this light, Abram’s focus on his survival reflects a concern to neutralize threats against the fulfillment of God’s promise. How could a dead man father a great nation? This episode (and the parallel account of Gen 20) presents Abram struggling with fear—the fear of losing God’s promised inheritance

As we read these accounts, we can recognize times in our own lives when the choices we make seem to lead us off track and away from God. And yet, in such cases, God is still present and able to bring us through any circumstance. He is faithful to His promise.

Abram was an idolater. He came from a pagan country and from a pagan nation and from a pagan home. His family worshipped idols, and estranged themselves from the one true God. Joshua gives us this little bit of information in Joshua 24:2. In speaking to Israel he says:

  Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.

Abram says to Sarai:

  When the Egyptians shall see thee … they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
  Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee (Genesis 12:12–13).

Is this the same man who trusted God, of whom we read, “He was the friend of God,” and “the father of the faithful”? Yes, it is the same man—none other than this same Abram, Abram’s action only proves how deceitful the flesh is, even in the believer, and how we ought to be on guard against it every moment. The Bible knows no such thing as the eradication of the flesh while we are here below. It is still in us to overpower us the moment we are off guard and leave the place of perfect obedience. The saintliest and holiest believer is not immune to the flesh and temptation, but is all too prone to yield and submit to it when it appears that obedience to God may cost him too great a price.

While Abram was unfaithful, God remained faithful. We might expect God to say, “Well, Abram, you got yourself into this mess, now you can stew in your own fat. I am going to give you up. I’m all through with you. I’ll call somebody else.” Did God do anything of the kind? Listen to the record:

  And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife (Genesis 12:17).

            <Synopsis>Scholars debate the precise identification of Ur of the Chaldeans from which Abram moved. The excavations of Sir Leonard Woolley at Ur in the 1920s and 1930 have led many to assume that the Ur from which Abram departed is the Sumerian Ur, that is, the great city in Lower Mesopotamia located on the Euphrates.

Other scholars have challenged this identification and suggested that Abram’s Ur is to be located in Upper Mesopotamia. Before Sumerian Ur came to light, writers were already equating Abraham’s Ur with Urfa (now called Edessa), which is about twenty miles northwest of Haran. A more recent proposal is to identify the Ur of Gen. 11 with a town called Ura in Hittite territory.

            <Synopsis>But it was not fitting that the one who had faith in God should remain among perverse people—the father of Abraham was in fact an idolater—because the company of the wicked often does harm to zealous people, especially to those whose zeal is new. That is why the Savior also proclaims, “If anyone wishes to follow me and does not hate his father, his brothers, his sisters, and even his wife and children, he cannot be my disciple.”

“They came to Haran.” Haran is an ancient and well-known city on the left bank of the Belikh, a tributary of the Euphrates; in cuneiform it is Harrānu(m), often mentioned in the Mari texts. Some scholars think that the name is Hurrian (F. M. T. Böhl and others); later it was karrhä, today once more Harran. The city belonged to the Mitanni empire, then to the Hittite, and afterwards to the Assyrian. The last Assyrian king fled there, and the last Babylonian king, Nabonidus, favored it.
Haran is mentioned in the context of the patriarchal story in Gen. 11:31*, 32*; 12:4*, 5*; 27:43*; 28:10*; 29:4*; in Gen. 24 it is the city of Nahor, Laban, and Rebecca. Such extensive attestation points to the likelihood that it is the place of origin of Abraham’s ancestors.

“Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, 3 and said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.’ 4 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. 5 Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot’s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. 6 And God spoke to this effect—that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. 7 ‘But I will judge the nation that they serve,’ said God, ‘and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.’ 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.

            <Title>Separation from the World</Title>
            <Text>Worldliness can be defined as a love for and a willingness to conform to the sinful values and practices of society. In addition, it can include attachment to the things (good or bad) of this life. Separation from the world means that we desire to know God above all else, seeking to conform one’s life to His ways and living by faith in His promises. In leaving his homeland, he demonstrated separation (or detachment) from the world. The writer of Hebrews argues that Abram was looking for a homeland, but that it was a “better one, a heavenly homeland” (Hebrews 11:13-16). Abram valued the promises of God over the things he possessed in Mesopotamia or would acquire in his travels. 
Like Abram, we are called to value the things of God above the temporal things of this life. We are often consumed with physical necessities, but the life of faith demands that we “…seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.”  We often seek to make as much money as we can, but the life of faith demands that we lay up treasures in heaven. Jesus’ interaction with a certain rich man and the subsequent response of his disciples is instructive. This man diligently sought after Jesus to find out what he needed to do to inherit eternal life. This man’s religious zeal was undeniable. From childhood he had dedicated his life to observing the Ten Commandments. However, one thing stood in the way of him obtaining eternal life - attachment to his great possessions. Since he valued material wealth over following Jesus, it was impossible for him to enter the kingdom of God.
By contrast, the twelve disciples (with the exception of Judas Iscariot) left everything to follow Jesus. In Mark 1:16-20 we read that Peter, Andrew, and the sons of Zebedee (James and John) left their occupations and family business to follow Jesus. In return, the Lord promised that they would receive a hundred times (along with persecutions) what they sacrificed in this life and in the “age to come eternal life” (Mark 10:30). Like Abram, the disciples demonstrated willingness to give up everything in order to live a life of faith under the Lord’s direction. What about us? Are we willing to trust God enough to detach from those things that bring status, influence, privilege, and comfort? Are we willing to embark on the journey of faith and give up the quest to create our own security in this life?

            <Title>Separation from Family and Friends</Title>
            <Text>God’s call to Abram demanded that he leave his family, but we know from 12:4-5 that he was accompanied by a sizeable caravan that included his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot. How did Sarai respond? Did she question whether he really heard from God? Did his relatives and friends try to persuade to remain in Haran? Did they question Abram’s mental stability in following a ‘God’ that was foreign to his people? How easy was it for Abram to leave his extended family and homeland? We don’t know the answers to these questions, but Abram responded with obedience. Later on in the narrative, we will discover that Abram remains faithful through the challenges of family strife and doubt. In addition, he will pass the test of supreme love for God by being willing to sacrifice his promised son Isaac to God.
The walk of faith demands supreme love for Jesus who said, “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me” (Matthew 10:37). Our Lord knows that for some, allegiance to himself will lead to family conflict. In such cases, we must not value our attachment to family so highly that we cave under the pressure of persecution. And like Abram, we must not cherish our families so highly that it prevents us from fulfilling God’s call on our lives.

            <Synopsis>The OT concept of repentance is expressed with two key Hebrew terms: שׁוּב (šûb) and נָחַם (nāḥam). The Hebrew word šûb (“turn”) expresses repentance as turning away from the wrong path, i.e., sinful behavior, and turning back toward God (Hos 3:5). Thus, repentance is an act of reorientation. The term nāḥam (“console”) can have a number of different meanings, including feeling sorrow or remorse; it can thus express the aspect of repentance that involves contrition for wrongdoing (Job 42:6).

            <Title>NT Context - Hebrews</Title>
            <Synopsis>
More specifically, the present verse forms the minor premise of a syllogism:

    they said they were looking for a homeland (v. 14)
    it could not have been their earthly birthplace (v. 15)
    so it must have been a home in heaven (v. 16a).

Moreover, this whole argument is a midrash tied to ξένοι καὶ παρεπίδημοι in → v. 13, and thus ultimately to Abraham’s words in Gn. 23:4, though Jacob is associated with him, perhaps as a second witness, and the language of exile has wider implications. The argument, as Hebrews develops it, has no direct basis in the OT text. Its immediate basis, moreover, is not Abraham’s words themselves, but the conclusion drawn from them in v. 14 that Abraham, and thus by implication the fathers generally, were looking for a homeland (still to be defined). This homeland, the author argues, could not have been Ur because Abraham knew where it was and could have returned there at any time. In fact, not only did he not do so, but he prevented his descendants from doing so

            <Text>The Rich Young Man
17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 19 You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’ ” 20 And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.” 21 And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 22 Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. 
23 And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” 24 And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” 26 And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, “Then who can be saved?” 27 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.” 28 Peter began to say to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.” 29 Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, 30 who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. 31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Mk 10:17–31). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

17–20. The rich man sought to honor Jesus by kneeling before him and addressing him as “Good Teacher.” Jesus’ objection to being called “good” is surprising to many. However, as Lane suggests, “In calling in question the man’s use of ‘good,’ Jesus’ intention is not to pose the question of his own sinlessness or oneness with the Father, but to set in correct perspective the honor of God.” This man undoubtedly viewed himself as “good” and needed to see that “his only hope is an utter reliance upon God, who alone can bestow eternal life.”18
The question, “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” further suggests the trust that this man had in Jesus. In reply to the man’s question, he recalls in summary fashion several of the ten commandments. The rich man had kept the ten commandments from childhood.
21. It is easy to think of the rich man as simply a pawn in Jesus’ teaching game, as if he gave this man the challenge to give his wealth away in order to use his failure as an object lesson. But Mark says that Jesus “loved him.” Jesus saw great potential in the man’s trust in him, desire for salvation, and righteous lifestyle. He wanted the man to be one of his chosen followers.
22. The rich man’s response reveals his sincerity. The first verb Mark uses to describe his reaction can be translated in two ways. The NIV translation, “the man’s face fell” is an attempt to express one meaning of the word στυγνάσας (stygnasas), which is that his appearance indicated he was gloomy or sad. The NRSV “he was shocked” expresses the alternative. In either case the next phrase says that he went away grieving, because he had great wealth. His wealth was the one thing he would not give up to inherit eternal life.
23–25. Jesus used this opportunity to teach his disciples about wealth. It is hard for anyone to enter the kingdom of God. It is especially hard for a rich man. In fact Jesus uses a hyperbolic illustration which characterizes a rich man’s possibilities for entering the kingdom of God as nonexistent. There is no ancient evidence for the oft-cited opinion that the eye of the needle was a gate into the walls of Jerusalem that a camel could enter only with great difficulty.20 Jesus had in mind the eye of a literal needle.
26. The shock expressed by the disciples in vv. 24 and 26 may reveal an underlying theology that supposes that rich men like the one they had just seen are rich because they are blessed by God for their righteousness. Their reaction, “Who then can be saved?” seems to imply that the rich would be especially likely to be saved. If they are not saved, then who can be?
27. Fortunately, impossibilities are possible for God. Rich men can be saved and so can the rest of humanity.
28. Peter’s statement sought credit for doing what Jesus told the rich man to do. The twelve had left everything they had behind and followed Jesus. Peter’s language reflects the responses of Peter and Andrew in 1:18 as “they left their nets and followed him” and of James and John in 1:20 as “they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.” The four fishermen had heeded the call and paid a high price.

29–30. Jesus began his reply to Peter with a commendation of his sacrifice. With his customary “I tell you the truth” he emphasized the truth and significance of his promise. Those who sacrifice houses or family or fields for the sake of Jesus or the gospel will receive one hundred times what they have sacrificed in the present life and in the age to come they will receive eternal life. In a later text Jesus tells the disciples that Christians will suffer great family trials as “brother will betray brother to death and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. All men will hate you because of me …” (13:12–13). This statement fills out both the sense in which many may have to leave family members and the ominous reference to “and with them, persecutions” in the promise of reward. Of course, Jesus’ promise does not involve literal multiplications of new family members or houses or fields. The sense in which one gains new family members may be illuminated by Mark 3:34, “Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.” For the multiple returns on houses and fields one might consult Acts 2:44–45: “All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.”


31. This paradoxical saying is apparently a rebuke of the down side of Peter’s statement. Peter has expressed the “me-first” attitude that keeps coming through in the disciples’ behavior (see 8:33–34, 38; 10:13, 35–37, 41) despite Jesus’ repeated efforts to dispel it. Jesus warns Peter that those who place themselves first will be last and vice versa. This statement is more fully illuminated in Matt 19:27–20:16. There Peter’s attitude is more clearly displayed by the addition of his statement, “What then will there be for us?” (19:27). The paradox of the first and last is followed by the parable of the Workers in the Vineyard and, in 20:16, a repetition of the paradox.

            <Text>To enter the kingdom of God one must submit to God’s rule so that God reigns over every aspect of life.
Disciples must be prepared to give up everything. Peter quickly reminds Jesus that they have done exactly that. Jesus promises that their sacrifice will not be for naught. Those who have left earthly attachments for the sake of the gospel will receive hundredfold rewards—but “with … persecutions” (10:30). In this age, those who become homeless will have a home among those who receive them (see 6:10). Those who surrender families will become part of a greater family not based on biological kinship (3:33–35). Those who leave fields will be given greater fields of mission opportunity (see Matt. 9:37–38). Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 400). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

The point of this story is not to drive home the need for all of Jesus’ followers to sell their possessions.Jesus did not insist that Zacchaeus sell all his goods and give them to the poor before he would deign to eat with him. Zacchaeus voluntarily offers to give up half of his possessions and to restore fourfold whatever he may have gained by fraud (see Ex. 22:1; Lev. 5:16; Num. 5:7). This willingness to make things right evokes Jesus’ response, “Today salvation has come to this house” (Luke 19:8–9). Jesus’ encounter with this rich man in Mark serves to illustrate how difficult it is for the rich (or any one, for that matter) to do this. Few are willing to risk divesting themselves of whatever provides them security in this life to enter a new quality of life under God’s rule. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (pp. 402–403). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

Wealth possesses high voltage and explosive energy since so many crave it and it strikes such reverence in the heart. No Christian is immune from the danger of Mammon. Covetousness is like a virus that takes residence in the soul and begins slowly to work its destruction. The love of acquisition and an appetite for self-gratification will deaden the instinct for self-sacrifice. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 403). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

Jesus said that the rich man in this story lacked one thing, though he did not specify what it was. In applying this passage to our contemporary situation we can imagine that he lacked the very things that we ourselves may lack. First, this man lacked for nothing. He had too much to give up. Money brings people many things (honor, respect, admiration, power, beauty, sex), which is why it is so alluring. Wealth cannot make one holy or purchase eternal life, and it does not offer any deep happiness, even when people get more than their fair share. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 406). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

The second thing this man lacked was trust. God requires something more than simply reverence for Jesus and zealous attempts at obedience. God requires radical trust. Like so many today, this rich man wanted to serve God on his own terms. He obeyed all the commandments that suited him but resisted giving his whole life over to God. He was “afraid to expose himself to the uncertainties and insecurities of the future” or to make himself vulnerable as a child. He accumulated possessions to secure his life in this world, and he accumulated obedience to the commandments to secure his life in the world to come.25 In a culture that has grown wary of commitment and risk, few want to bet their whole lives on Jesus. They also want to keep a material safety net and refuse to disentangle themselves from something that brings status, influence, and privilege. Few are willing to trust that there will be other brothers and sisters in the faith who will watch over them and care for them, partly because we do not watch out for them. To have life, one must trust God and give up the quest to create one’s own security. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 407). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.</Text>

            <Text>37. It is affection that binds households together; thus Jesus moves on to consider the place of love. He assumes that there will be love between parents and children, but claims for himself a higher place in his disciples’ affection than that which they accord to their nearest and dearest on earth, and that in a society that held it a dreadful thing to put anyone higher than one’s parents. 


Loves88 is a significant word; it points to the warmest affection. Jesus does not bid his followers love their parents or their children (nor, on the other hand, does he forbid warm affection in the family). He simply assumes that family members will love one another. But he is concerned that they must not value their attachment to the members of their families so highly that he is pushed into the background. This has important implications for an understanding of the person of Jesus. 


No mere man has the right to claim a love higher than that for parents or children; it is only because he is who he is that Jesus can look for such love. The words imply that he is more than a merely human teacher and leader. Of the one who lacks this love for him he says that he is not worthy of me (GNB, “is not fit to be my disciple”). 


We must not forget that Jesus knew what it was to experience misunderstanding in the family, for his own thought him mad (Mark 3:21). Jesus is not asking from his followers something he did not know for himself.

            <Text>37. Because of the division which Jesus provokes within families (vv. 34–36), true discipleship may bring a conflict of loyalties, and in that case, following Jesus must take precedence over the natural love of family (the Greek word is phileō, natural affection, not agapaō, the loving commitment which is a Christian characteristic). 


The Christian may even have to leave his family (19:29). The Lucan parallel (Luke 14:26) calls for ‘hatred’ of the family, but Matthew’s version correctly interprets this Semitic idiom (cf. Gen. 29:31; Deut. 21:15; Mal. 1:2–3) as an expression of prior loyalty or of choice rather than of actual dislike. Jesus calls not for an unloving attitude, but for a willingness to put him first in the concrete situation where the calls of Jesus and of family conflict. 



For the Rabbis too the claims of the teacher came before those of the father (Mishnah, BM 2:11). For worthy, see on v. 11; ‘not the right sort to be my disciple’.

            <Text>This passage is unique to Luke, though verses 26–27 are like Matthew 10:37–38 and verses 34–35 are similar to Matthew 5:13 and Mark 9:49–50. It is extremely significant that this passage is addressed to large crowds. Jesus offered himself to all, but he also was honest from the very beginning of his preaching about what the journey would involve. What Jesus asks for is first place in one’s heart. That is what successful discipleship requires.

So Jesus calls for a follower who will hate his mother and father, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life. The point of the list is that no other relationship is first for a disciple. “Hate” is used figuratively and suggests a priority of relationship. Jesus is first. To follow Jesus means to follow Jesus, not anyone or anything else. A disciple is a learner, and the primary teacher in life is Jesus. This total loyalty is crucial, given the rejection and persecution that lie ahead. If his followers care more about family than about Jesus, when families are divided under pressure of persecution, they will choose against Jesus. This is what lies behind Jesus’ remarks. Discipleship is not possible if Jesus is not the teacher.

            <Title>God was choosing Abram to bless the whole</Title>
            <Text>

God was choosing Abram to bless the whole earth—all the families of the earth—with the promised seed, the Messiah, the Savior of the world. How do we know this? From Scripture: Scripture clearly tells us that this is a reference to the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. This will be seen in a moment. But common logic and reason also tells us that the promised seed is a reference to the Messiah. Just think: this is a blessing so great that it blesses all the families upon earth, all the families who have lived or ever will live. A blessing this great could only refer to the Savior. Only God Himself—through His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ—could do something so great that it would literally bless every single family upon earth throughout all the generations of human history. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 26). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

 As stated above, Scripture tells us exactly what God meant in this promise: this is a direct—very specific—reference to the promised seed, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah and Savior of the world.
1)	Note the Old Testament references.
a)	God gave the promise of the Savior at least three times to Abram.
 (Ge. 12:3).
(Ge. 22:18).
b)	God confirmed the promise of the Savior to Isaac, Abram’s son.
 (Ge. 26:3–4).
c)	God also confirmed the promise of the Savior to Jacob.
(Ge. 28:14). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 26). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Note the New Testament references and interpretation.
a)	The first New Testament reference is Acts 3:25. Peter preached this glorious fact: Jesus Christ fulfilled the covenant given to Abraham and the other godly fathers of history. What covenant? The covenant of the promised seed, the Lord Jesus Christ, who would bless people and turn them away from their wicked ways. Note this clear declaration: Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 26). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ 26 God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.” The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ac 3:24–26). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

	The third New Testament reference is Ga. 3:8. This verse explains a surprising fact: the promise of the promised seed actually contained the gospel. The gospel of Jesus Christ was actually being preached to Abraham when God promised to give him the promised seed. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 27). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

7 Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” 9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 3:7–9). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

The fourth New Testament reference is Ga. 3:16. This verse gives a clear explanation: the promise of the seed is singular, not plural. The promised seed does not refer to many persons, but to one person, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior and Messiah of the world Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 27). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

16 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 3:16). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

Note this also: a person can only become a child of God’s—Abram’s seed (descendant)—and inherit the promise made to Abram, by faith in Christ, by believing and trusting Him. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 27). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

26 for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 3:26–29). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

3 (12:6) Faith—Testing—Pilgrim—Pilgrimage: there was the testing of faith: Abram reached the land, but he could not settle down within it; he had to pass through the land as a pilgrim, for there was opposition there (the Canaanites). Think for a moment: when Abram arrived in Canaan, what was he expecting to find? A land uninhabited and unpossessed, a free land ready to be claimed by the first pioneer to settle within its borders? Or, was Abram expecting the land to be settled and possessed by people? Scripture does not say, but when Abram crossed the border of Canaan, he found a land already inhabited. The Canaanites, a godless nation of people, were already there. Abram faced a formidable enemy if he began to claim the land. He could easily see that he was not going to possess the land within the foreseeable future. All kinds of questions must have flashed across his mind. He must have been gripped with …
•	uncertainty
•	misgivings
•	hesitation
•	questioning
Could it be that he had misread God, that he had made a mistake?
Abram’s faith was tested, sorely tested. The faith of this great pioneer for God was tested to the nth degree. He was in the land, but he could not yet possess it. Opposition and strong forces stood toe to toe against his claim to the promised land. What was he to do?
⇒	Should he return? Should he give up his faith, turn around and go back home to Haran or to Ur of the Chaldees?
⇒	Should he continue to believe God, following after God’s promises, continue to claim the promises of God despite the opposition and the impossible situation that confronted him? Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 33). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


Thought 1. There is a beautiful analogy for the believer in this experience of Abram. Just as Abram reached the promised land but did not yet physically possess it, so the believer reaches the promised land of heaven immediately upon conversion, but does not yet physically possess it.
When a person is saved—when he truly begins to follow after God and His promises—things happen to him in relation to heaven.
(1)	God counts the believer as already in heaven (see note 3—Ep. 2:6). The believer is not physically in heaven, but he is as good as there. God has promised heaven to him, and what God promises always takes place; thus, the believer is counted as being in heaven, as already there. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 34). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— 6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Eph 2:4–7). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

The believer is immediately placed in the heavenly realm or the spiritual realm of life. That is, his mind and thoughts are focused upon heaven and the things of heaven, upon God and His promises. It is God’s Spirit that pulls his mind to spiritual things, that stirs his mind to focus upon heaven and the things of heaven. As stated, the believer is not bodily in heaven, but his mind is to be kept within the realm (upon the things) of heaven. In fact, if he is truly following after God and His promises, he naturally keeps his mind and thoughts upon God and His promises—the Spirit of God stirs him to so focus his mind. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 34). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

The believer’s faith in the promised land of heaven is constantly tested just as Abram’s was. In fact, the believer is never free from enemies who oppose his inheriting the promised land of heaven. Godless foes—death, Satan, and all kinds of trials and temptations—stand against him while he is living within this world. Just like Abram, the believer is to continue trusting God: he is to believe that God will defeat all the enemies of the promised land, including that final enemy, death. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 34). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Just like Abram, the believer is a pilgrim upon earth: he lives upon earth, but he is only traveling and passing through, ever seeking for the promised land of heaven. The believer is a citizen of both earth and heaven (Ph. 3:20–21). Note this: just like Abram …
•	the believer journeys upon earth, but his destination is the promised land
•	this is not the believer’s home; heaven is his home
•	the believer’s mind and thoughts are upon the earth when necessary, but they are mostly upon the promised land of God
•	the believer’s faith and hope are not in this world, but in God and in the land promised by God
Again, the believer is just like Abram: he is a pilgrim upon earth. He lives for the earth, yes, to make it a far better place; but he also lives for heaven, knowing that this earth is only his temporary home. Simply stated, the true believer knows what Abram knew: he is only a pilgrim upon earth; the promised land of heaven is his eternal destiny. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 34–35). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

20 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Php 3:20–21). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

This is what is meant by the pilgrimage of faith. The believer actually lives upon earth, but he believes that in Christ he lives in the promised land of heaven, and he believes that some day he will bodily live there. Thus, the believer lives upon earth as a pilgrim: his life is a pilgrimage of faith. His life, movements, and being—all that he is—are a pilgrimage of faith.
The point is this: when a person believes in God and His promises, he lives for God and His promises. He lives for something far beyond this earth. This earth is not his home, not his destination or resting place. His faith is in God and in the promised land; thus he lives upon earth as a pilgrim. His life upon earth becomes a pilgrimage of faith. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 35). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. 8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord. 9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb. The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ge 12:7–9). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

What was Abram’s response? Abram made the decision for God, to continue following after God and His promises. Note that he built an altar to the Lord who had appeared to him (v. 8). The altar had at least seven purposes (see Deeper Study # 1—Ge. 8:20 for more discussion):
⇒	To offer sacrifices to God, asking forgiveness for unbelief and sins.
⇒	To make a rededication to God, renewing his commitment to God.
⇒	To seek God’s continued presence and guidance.
⇒	To worship the Lord: to worship the very Person who had met his need.
⇒	To acknowledge the Lord, that the Lord alone could fulfill so great a promise, that he was totally dependent upon the Lord.
⇒	To praise the Lord, to praise Him for giving so wonderful a promise.
⇒	To testify to the Lord, to bear witness to the Lord’s glorious goodness in meeting his need and in giving so great a promise. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 36). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Thought 1. James Montgomery Boice states the point well:
I note this sequence: first, Abram arrives in a place; second, God speaks to him; third, he builds an altar.… I think the sequence is to be understood as being repeated, though it is not always spelled out in detail. First, Abram arrived at a place. Second, he recognized God’s presence. Third, he raised an altar as a testimony to God’s claim upon that place and on those who should ever after live there. Abram passed on—to other places and eventually to glory—but the altars remained. They remained as witness to the fact that in this place a child of God once knelt and prayed, proclaimed the gospel of grace, and claimed that spot for God’s glory.
We are called to do that—wherever we are and at all times. We are called to be pilgrims, but that does not mean that we are to pass through this world and leave it untouched. For the master of the heavenly city is master of this world too, and we are ambassadors of His kingdom and are charged with proclaiming His rule, and actually establishing that rule, wherever our pilgrimage takes us. Do you live on this or that street? On this or that block? Then you must build your altar on that street and claim that neighborhood for Jesus. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).

&quot;The greatness of Abram’s name is clearly seen in secular history.
⇒Abram gave rise to both the Jewish and Arab nations of the earth. Both peoples trace their ancestry back to Abram and call him the father of their people.
⇒Abram was to become the father of kings (Ge. 17:6), and Sarah the mother of nations and kings (Ge. 17:16).
⇒Abram was known as a mighty prince by the surrounding nations even in his day (Ge. 21:22–34; 23:6).
⇒Abram was also known as a prophet of God (Ge. 20:7).
b)But more than secular history, Abram’s name is great in the annals of faith. All believers (all those who understand that Abram is the father of faith) honor Abram. The very name of Abram is synonymous with faith. &quot;
Link
&quot;#Abram has blessed the earth with a great example of faith, perhaps the greatest of examples. Abram believed God against all odds.
⇒He believed God for the promised land even when he knew nothing about the land, not even where it was; and he continued to believe God for the land all through his life, even though he never possessed a single acre.
⇒He believed God for the promised seed—a great nation of people—when it was humanly impossible for him and his dear wife to have a child.
⇒He believed God for the promised seed—the Savior—even though he had been living the most undeserving life when God first called him to turn away from the world and follow God. This we shall see in the next note.&quot;

&quot;The memory of Abram’s name is precious (great) to believers because they know this: if they follow after the glorious promises given to Abram, then the great inheritance given to Abram will also become their inheritance.
“For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.… Therefore it [righteousness] is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all” (Ro. 4:13, 16).&quot;

8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” 9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.

            <Text>The Call of Abram
12 Now the Lord said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. 2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” 

4 So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, 6 Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. 7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. 8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord. 9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.

But it is also a difficult mission. As it was difficult for Abram to leave his country, his kindred, and especially his father’s house (his immediate relatives), so Jesus declares that ours is a difficult mission. He says, “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it” (Matt 10:37–39). We may lose our life on this mission, but in losing it we will find it.
Jesus begins his Sermon on the Mount with a ninefold blessing for his people—just as God sent Abram on his mission with a complete set of blessings. Jesus proclaims:
“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.…
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.…
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”
(Matt 5:3, 5, 10)
The poor in spirit will find life in the kingdom of heaven; the meek will find life on the new earth; the persecuted will find life in the kingdom of heaven.
Did you notice, Jesus says that the meek “will inherit the earth.” The new earth will be the inheritance of God’s people. As Canaan was Israel’s inheritance, so the new earth will be God’s people’s inheritance. The new earth will be God’s gift to his people. John saw “the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” And he heard a voice from the throne saying,
“See, the home of God is among mortals.
He will dwell with them;
they will be his peoples,
and God himself will be with them.”
(Rev 21:3)
And then John sees Paradise on earth. He writes, “Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.… On either side of the river is the tree of life.… Nothing accursed will be found there any more. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him; they will see his face” (Rev 22:1–4).
One day this earth will again be like Paradise, “the garden of God,” a wonderful place with plenty of food and drink, meaningful work caring for God’s creation, and above all, close fellowship with God. The restored earth will be God’s gift to his people.
But the gift-character of the new earth does not diminish our calling today to reclaim the world for God’s kingdom. Jesus’ command still holds: “Go … and make disciples of all nations.… And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matt 28:19–20). God gives his people the earth in order to reclaim it for the kingdom of God. Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 155–157).

            <Text>Abram and Sarai in Egypt
10 Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land. 11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance, 12 and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me, but they will let you live. 13 Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.” 14 When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 15 And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 16 And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels. 

17 But the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. 18 So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.” 20 And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.

            <Text>Historical/Cultural context

Famines were not unusual in ancient Mesopotamia. Often caused by drought, famines jeopardized the food supplies of animals and people alike, and they quickly became a matter of life and death. Agriculture in Egypt was less dependent on rain than agriculture in Canaan: The regular flooding of the Nile provided water for crops. During times of famine, people living in Canaan often traveled to Egypt, knowing they would likely find food there. Egyptian tomb carvings from around the 20th century BC such as the Beni Hasan mural show Semitic people traveling to Egypt.

            <Text>&quot;There was a famine in the land of plenty, the land flowing with milk and honey, a famine in the land to which Abram had gone in faith and obedience to God’s own command and word. Certainly here is a severe test of faith&quot;
Link
&quot;The moment we are willing to yield to the new light that God gives us, He moves us on to the next test; and each one makes us stronger in the faith&quot;
Link
&quot;The lesson taught here is that it is better to starve in the place where God wants you to be than to live in luxury, but not according to the will of God, in Egypt.&quot;
Link
&quot;There comes a disturbing situation, a famine in the land. How it must have troubled Abram. Was he not where God wanted him? Was he not in the place of fellowship? Then why a famine in the land? It was indeed a great test of faith, and Abram, we are sorry to say, failed, miserably failed. Instead of trusting God, he turned to his own reason, and sought the solution in the arm of the flesh. &quot;
Link
&quot;Abram first of all lost his sense of peace and security; he began to worry. He feared for Sarai his wife; for she was very beautiful, and he feared that these conscienceless Egyptians might kill him and take Sarai. How much better to have trusted the Lord in Canaan. &quot;
Link
&quot;When the Egyptians shall see thee … they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee (Genesis 12:12–13).
Is this the same man who trusted God, of whom we read, “He was the friend of God,” and “the father of the faithful”? Yes, it is the same man—none other than this same Abram, Abram’s action only proves how deceitful the flesh is, even in the believer, and how we ought to be on guard against it every moment.&quot;
Link
&quot;The Bible knows no such thing as the eradication of the flesh while we are here below. It is still in us to overpower us the moment we are off guard and leave the place of perfect obedience. &quot;
Link
&quot;While Abram was unfaithful, God remained faithful. We might expect God to say, “Well, Abram, you got yourself into this mess, now you can stew in your own fat. I am going to give you up. I’m all through with you. I’ll call somebody else.” Did God do anything of the kind? Listen to the record:
And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife (Genesis 12:17).&quot;
Link
&quot;God even allows mistakes to be committed by us in order that He may use those experiences and mistakes to prevent something more tragic later on.&quot;
Link
God’s permissive will. 
&quot;We need to recognize this great fundamental truth, that God permitted Abram to be tempted and to fall, knowing that he would make this grievous error and commit a great sin, in order that God might use even this failure and this sin as a means of teaching Abram a still greater lesson which might prevent a still greater tragedy in his life later on.&quot;
Link
&quot;Abram trusted God to save him, but he could not trust God to keep him. Regarding his being kept, Abram felt that he had to do something himself. There are thousands of poor souls today who trust God to save their souls, and then think that they have to do the rest. They cannot trust God to keep them, even to the end.&quot;
Link
&quot;There is another lessson here. We trust God for eternal things, but we do not dare to trust Him for the material. We say, “Amen, hallelujah, Jesus is my Saviour; I know whom I have believed; hallelujah for salvation” but the moment something goes wrong, all our joy is gone. One of the family gets sick; then we begin to doubt, and cannot trust the Lord any more.&quot;
Link
&quot;Here we have an incident that is tremendous in its lesson. A believer who is out of fellowship with God can do meaner and lower things than the sinner who has never been saved.&quot;
Link
&quot;We have the evidence here that Abram in a moment of doubt showed that the old nature and the old doubts were still present within him: he went down into Egypt. Other Biblical characters had similar experiences. We have but to recall the case of Noah and his drunkenness, David and his sin, Solomon and his wives, Peter and his denial of our Lord. “Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.”&quot;

And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin?

Context
• What has happened so far in the narrative? Have there been any major events, characters or themes?
• What has happened just prior to the section you are reading?

Observation

What do you learn about the main characters in this section? How does the author describe them? How do they describe themselves?
Moses describes the men of Sodom as wicked and great sinners against the Lord
Abram
Displays faith in God through building and worshipping God at altars
Lot
Displays poor decision-making
Canaanites and Perizzites

Is time or place significant in the events that happen in the passage?

Is there a conflict or high point in the passage?

And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock.
The high point comes with God speaking to Abram to reaffirm His promise in light of his recent decision

Do you think there is a main point or theme in this section of the story?
God honors Abram’s display of faith through the conflict with Lot and his herdsmen. 
in this scene Abraham’s faith in God is so secure that he can extend land to Lot to make peace. In faith and worship, he builds altars to the Lord, and God rewards him with his voice of promise to give him the land. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 220). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.


What surprises are there?
Surprised that Abram did not assert his right to God’s promise to give him Canaan

Meaning

Are there any ‘editorial’ comments from the author about the events in the narrative? How do these comments illuminate what is happening?
The editorial comment in 13:10 foreshadows the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
The editorial comment in 13:13 notes the wickedness of the men of Sodom, which apparently chooses to ignore. These notes highlights Lot’s poor choice. In ch. 14, Lot will be captured as a slave of war.
Does someone in the narrative learn something or grow in some way? How? What does this person learn?
the altars signify Abraham’s return to faith and his proclamation of claiming the land in the name of God. The narrator underscores Abraham’s return to the place of faith and worship by the repetitive phrase “as far as the site where his tent had been earlier, to the site where he had first built an altar” Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001)
What started as a situation of discontent, quarreling, and friction has now turned into one of divine promise and blessing. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). 
How does the passage point forward to what God is going to do in the future? Does it prophesy or anticipate Jesus Christ in some way?
God reaffirms his promise to give Canaan to Abram and to make him a great nation
Included among the offspring of Abram will be Jesus, the incarnate eternal Word.
Abraham, giving up his rights and implicitly risking the Promised Land to the reprobate Moabites and Ammonites (19:37–38; Deut. 23:3–6; Ezra 9:1), by faith inherits forever “all the land” and “an offspring like the dust” (see Gen. 13:15–16). He prefigures Christ, who humbles himself to the cross and then is so highly exalted that every rational being in heaven and earth will bow the knee at his name. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). 
How could you sum up the meaning of this passage in your own words?

Application

How does this passage challenge your understanding about who God is and what he is like?
God’s jurisdiction and sovereignty are not confined to his land. His authority does not stop at the border. He judges an Egyptian Pharaoh for his sins, showing the extension of his power into foreign soil. So too the residents of Sodom may be tagged as “sinners against Yahweh.” Hamilton, V. P. (1990). 
Is there some attitude or behaviour you need to change?
Faith in God gives me the freedom to be generous
Faith in God gives me the freedom to put aside selfish ambition
true Christianity renounces consumerism. Instead, Christians are to relinquish their rights in order to enrich others, trusting God’s promises to provide. Abraham, secure in God, can give up his land. When we are secure in Christ, we do not have to grasp greedily for possessions. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001)
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Php 2:3). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.
Faith in God gives me the freedom to be a peacemaker
Christians are to give up their rights and prosperity to restore relationship between people. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001).
Only surrendering the heart and will to God creates peace - it is not secured in circumstances, the ideal environment, etc.
The commendation of peacemakers
Mt 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Ro 14:19 So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.
The importance of pursuing peace
Ro 12:18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
Heb 12:14 Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord
Sometimes brothers must separate for the sake of peace Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001).


1. Where did the events in this chapter take place (v3)? (Locate this on the map.)

Bethel/Ai
Jordan Valley
Canaan
Sodom/Gomorrah
Hebron

2. What had Abram built at this place (v4)? Describe what this is. (Think: Abram built these in many places. What does this tell us about his character?)

Abram built an altar near Bethel
The physical symbol is a reminder to Abraham of God’s promises and Abraham’s earlier faith. The narrator’s comment on this image suggests to the reader that Abraham has returned to a position of faith, the place where the reader should also dwell. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001).

3. What problem arose between Lot and Abram and what was the cause of the problem?

Disputing arose between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot due to lack of land space

4. What proposal did Abram make to solve the problem? What does this say about Abram’s character?

He gave Lot the option to choose whatever area he wanted to settle
Abram offers Lot a choice between going “right” or “left” when they separate (Gen 13:9). In biblical geography, “right” often indicates the south, so “left” here would indicate the north (see Wenham 1987, 297).
Giving first choice to Lot was both generous and risky. Commentators usually emphasize Abram’s magnanimity, his noble gesture in giving Lot first choice, as a sign of his renewed trust in Yahweh to fulfill the promise

5. List and explain at least three passages elsewhere that show the importance of peace and making peace. (Think: Under what circumstances may we give in to others to have peace, and under what circumstances would it be wrong to do so?)

The commendation of peacemakers
Mt 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Ro 14:19 So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.
The importance of pursuing peace
Ro 12:18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
Heb 12:14 Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord
Sometimes brothers must separate for the sake of peace Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001).

6. What choice did Lot make and why?

Lot chose the Jordan Valley, near Sodom
The attraction of the Jordan Valley is made evident in Gen 13:10 where the land is described as “well-watered” like “Egypt” and the “garden of Yahweh.”

7. What were the people like in the area Lot moved to?

The men of Sodom were very wicked
Sodomites, not living in the promised land, are culpable as sinners against Yahweh. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). 

8. Special Assignment: Using cross references, find and explain passages that show what results Lot’s choice eventually brought on him and his family. (Think: What lessons can we learn about the danger of material attractions?)

Lot’s choice to go east represents separation—from Abram, from the promised land, and from God. 
In Genesis, “east” frequently indicates moving in a direction away from God or toward danger (compare the expulsion from Eden in Gen 3:24 or Cain’s exile in Gen 4:16; see Mathews 2005, 130–1; McKeown 2008, 84).
Abram trusts Yahweh for provision, while Lot chooses what appears to be the best land for himself. Like Eve in Gen 3:6, Lot is attracted by the deceptively good appearance of what he sees.
His decision creates a chain of events that will lead to the founding of the Moabites and the Ammonites as distinct peoples in the Transjordan region, outside of Canaan (see Gen 19:30–38).
Lot’s decision making process (allowing himself to be guided by what attracts) will put him in dire circumstances. Lot chooses by sight in contrast to Abram’s faithful choice to trust God.

A Living Sacrifice
12 I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. 2 Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

            <Text>Abram and Lot Separate
13 So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb. 

2 Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. 3 And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 4 to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the Lord. 5 And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, 6 so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, 7 and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land. 

8 Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. 9 Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.” 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) 11 So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other. 12 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. 13 Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord. 

14 The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, 15 for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. 16 I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. 17 Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.” 18 So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.

            <Text>


	Abram &amp; Lot faced a threefold problem

5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.

a.	An unwise desire: To stay together even when the land could not support both of them

6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.

b.	A severe conflict between workers
c.	A poor godly influence, a poor testimony to the worldDS1,2

7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

2.	Abram sought to solve the conflict
a.	He suggested the need for keeping the peace

8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.

b.	He offered to give the best land to Lot, sacrificing his own right to choose first

9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thy-self, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

3.	Lot was misled by the lust of the eyes &amp; by what looked good: By appearance
a.	Selfishly, Lot “lifted up his eyes” to look for the best land
b.	Selfishly, Lot looked &amp; focused his eyes upon what appeared to be the best landDS3
c.	Selfishly, Lot chose all the best land for himself

10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

4.	Abram lived where he could prosper spiritually, Lot where he could prosper in the world
a.	Lot settled near Sodom
b.	Lot settled where the people were wicked &amp; very sinful
5.	Abram’s faith was rewarded
a.	When: After separation from the worldly
b.	How: By the Lord’s Word—“Lift up now your eyes”
c.	What: A threefold reward
1)	The land
2)	The seed

12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.
14 And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

3)	The right to claim the land: All the land upon which he walked

15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.

6.	Abram’s faith continued onDS4

16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

a.	He obeyed God
b.	He worshipped God (in Hebron) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 44). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

            <Title>Repentance 13:1-4</Title>
            <Text>5 (13:1–4) Repentance: the fifth step in weak faith is repentance. Every believer who is weak in faith and wanders off needs to repent and return to God. By repenting and returning to God, the believer will, over a period of time, become strong in faith. God always receives the repentant believer and blesses him richly, ever so richly. God always forgives sin, no matter how terrible the sin has been, if the person repents—truly repents—and turns to the Lord and begins to follow Him.

This is exactly what happened to Abram. Note that Abram returned to God and the promised land. He could have returned to Ur of the Chaldees or to Haran or even to some other country and land. Unquestionably, he and Sarah were discouraged and downcast, feeling deep guilt, shame, and embarrassment. They were probably gripped by dread, apprehension, and even some fear, hating to face the members of their household and the laborers of their herds. But Abram and Sarah did exactly what was needed.

a. They separated from Egypt, from the world of ungodliness and worldly lusts (v. 1).

b. They repented and began their journey back to the promised land, to Bethel. Apparently, Pharaoh feared the God of Abram so much that he let Abram keep the gifts he had given for Sarah, hoping to pacify Abram’s God (v. 2). Note that Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.
Bethel was the place where Abram had begun his journey in the promised land and had built an altar for worship (vv. 3–4). All this points to Abram’s repenting and turning back to God. In fact, Scripture clearly says that “Abram called on the name of the Lord.” And when repentant believers call on the Lord—sincerely call—the Lord restores them, even to a more glorious position of blessing and service than before.
“Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord” (Ac. 3:19).
“Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee” (Ac. 8:22).
“If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land” (2 Chr. 7:14).
“Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon” (Is. 55:7).
“But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word” (Is. 66:2).
“Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up” (Ho. 6:1).
“The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit” (Ps. 34:18). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 42–43). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

            <Title>Abram Separated from Lot: Selfish Vs. Unselfish</Title>
            <Text>Abram Separated from Lot: Selfish Vs. Unselfish Faith, 13:5–18
(13:5–18) Introduction: Abram treated Lot like a son. Lot was Abram’s nephew. When Lot’s father, Haran, died, Abram took Lot in and reared him just as he would his own son. But as we shall see, Lot paid little attention to spiritual matters. This is what this passage is all about. The passage draws a sharp contrast between Lot and Abram, between a carnal, worldly believer and a spiritual believer. It gives us a picture of unselfish faith vs. selfish faith.
⇒	Abram lived by faith; Lot lived by sight (Ge. 13:8–9; 13:10–11).
⇒	Abram was giving and unselfish; Lot was greedy and selfish (Ge. 13:8–9; 13:10–11).
⇒	Abram was humble and respectful; Lot was prideful and self-exalting (Ge. 13:8–9; 13:10–11).
⇒	Abram sought after God and His promises; Lot sought after the bright lights, possessions, and pleasures of this world (Ge. 13:14–18; 13:10–11).
⇒	Abram was spiritually minded; Lot was worldly minded (Ge. 13:8, 12; 13:10–12).
⇒	Abram looked for the heavenly city that is eternal, whose builder and maker is God; Lot looked for a worldly city that was built by man and offered the wealth, position, and bright lights of the world (He. 11:10, 13–16; Ge. 13:12–13).
⇒	Abram became the father of all who believe (Ro. 4:11); Lot became the father of only two daughters who brought utter disgrace to his name (Ge. 19:33–38).
⇒	Abram was made “heir of the world” (Ro. 4:13); Lot lost all his possessions in the fiery destruction of Sodom living the latter years of his life in a cave (Ge. 19:30).

            <Text>Leadership Ministries Notes on Genesis 13

Remember: Lot was the son of Abram’s brother, Haran. When Haran died, Abram took Lot into his household. Thus, when Abram left Ur of the Chaldees for the promised land, Lot went with him (see Ge. 11:31). We know from Scripture that Lot himself, at some point, became a believer and began to follow after God and His promises. But Lot lived a carnal life, an extremely carnal and worldly life (2 Pe. 2:7–8; see note—Ge. 19:1–38 for more discussion). The first sight of his carnality and love for the world shows itself in this passage. Obviously, Lot had become a wealthy young man through the years while he was with his uncle, Abram. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 45). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verse 6
However, the situation was now critical: there just was not enough good pasture to handle the large herds and flocks of the two ranchers. No matter how much they wanted to stay together, no matter how close their relationship, they needed to separate. Abram in particular recognized this. He was the one who was to suggest separating; this will be seen in just a moment. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 45). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verse 7

b. Problem two: a conflict between the workers of the two men was being waged over the best pasture land and water holes. Note that the conflict was not between Abram and Lot; it was only between their laborers. The two men had not yet been drawn into the conflict; their relationship had not yet been affected. But Abram was wise enough to know that petty arguments and conflicts eventually affect everyone unless they are squelched in the beginning.

c. Problem three: Abram and Lot were about to become a poor testimony to the world (v. 7). Note that the Canaanites and Perizzites were living in the same area. This means they were watching the conflict between the workers of Abram and Lot, probably wondering how the two large sheiks (ranchers) would solve the problem. It was just a poor testimony for men of the true God to allow a situation to exist that would cause severe conflict. Remember: one of the very purposes for God choosing Abram was for Abram to bear witness to the other nations, witness that there is only one living and true God, only one Savior and hope for man. Thus Abram knew that he faced a unique opportunity to bear witness to the surrounding neighbors. How he handled the situation would give either a strong witness or a weak witness for God.

 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 45). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verses 8-9

a. First, Abram suggested the need for keeping peace between them and their workers. They were brothers and brothers should not fight; brothers should care for each other and look after each other. Abram knew that all kinds of trials and enemies were going to confront them as they followed God and sought the promised land. They were going to need one another; thus they needed to be at peace and ready to help when help was needed. The trials and enemies of life are just too great for brothers not to stand together against whatever confronts them. Abram knew this; thus he stepped forward to suggest peace before the conflict erupted into a crisis.


b. Second, Abram offered to give the best pasture land to Lot, offered to sacrifice his right to claim the best for himself (v. 9). Abram had the right to choose first, and he deserved that right.
⇒	He was the older, the head of the family
⇒	He was the person to whom God had promised the land
⇒	He was the leader, the one who had led the pilgrims to the promised land
But Abram did an astounding thing: he offered the first choice of land to Lot. Abram gave up his claim to choose first. By this he illustrates perfectly what it means …
•	to act unselfishly
•	to give sacrificially
•	to be humble and meek

 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 45–46). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Abram had great faith in God. He had learned this lesson in the famine experience when he failed to trust God’s provision and went down into Egypt for help (Ge. 13:10f). Abram had learned that God would take care of him, that God expected the true believer to trust Him. Thus, Abram was now willing to seek God and His righteousness above all else, willing to trust God to take care of him even if Lot acted selfishly and usurped Abram’s rights and chose the best pasture land for himself. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 46). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verses 10-11

Selfishly, Lot “lifted up his eyes” to look for the best region of the land. Lot jumped at the chance to get the best region. The idea is that he immediately lifted up his eyes and began to survey the land to see where the most watered and fertile region was. This should not have been the first thing he did, but it was. Lot was selfish and greedy. How can we say this? Because he should have “lifted up his eyes” to Abram, the man of God and the head of the family, and insisted that he choose first. But Lot did not do this; in fact, there is no record that he even thanked or showed appreciation to Abram for the privilege of choosing first. Lot simply “lifted up his eyes” and immediately began to survey the land, looking for the very best land to claim. Lot was filled with selfishness and greed, wanting the very best for himself despite the fact that the right to choose first belonged to Abram.
Thought 1. What a selfish act! Keep in mind that Abram had taken Lot in and treated him like a son when Lot’s father died. Abram reared Lot, educated him and got him started in business. Most likely, Lot owed everything to Abram. Yet here Lot was usurping the right of Abram by failing to acknowledge Abram’s position and contribution to his life. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 47). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
It was the land that had given rise to the infamous, ungodly cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Note that the cities still existed; God had not yet destroyed them. Lot, no doubt, knew of their ungodliness; yet he was still considering the Jordan Valley.
Thought 1. Lot ignored the ungodly behavior of Sodom and Gomorrah. In blindness, he must have denied that their ungodliness would influence the spiritual life of his dear family.
c. Selfishly, Lot chose all the best land for himself. He chose the whole plain of the Jordan River.
⇒	He selfishly chose the whole region, refusing to offer Abram at least part of the fertile plain of Jordan.
⇒	He foolishly chose the region where ungodliness flourished.
⇒	He selfishly chose material wealth over the safety of his family’s salvation and spiritual growth.
Thought 1. Note two striking lessons.
(1)	People move for all kinds of reasons: seeking a better position, job, scenery, more money, a larger house, and on and on the reasons could go. When believers move, they must always look at the spiritual impact of the move:
⇒	the number of fellow believers within an area
⇒	the availability of Bible centered churches that really preach Christ
⇒	the moral and spiritual atmosphere of the community, schools, businesses, and institutions of the area
⇒	the worldly places that exist to tempt the children
(2)	We must never be misled by appearance, by the lust of the eyes, and by what looks good. There is far more to life than the physical and material, far more than the bright lights, pleasures, possessions, positions, and wealth of this world. The things of this world do not satisfy the human soul: they leave the soul empty, dissatisfied, and unfulfilled. The only thing that satisfies the human soul is God and the things of God, things such as purpose, meaning, and significance; things such as love, joy, peace, goodness, faith, discipline, and control. The fulness of life comes only from God and from God alone; therefore, the major decisions of life must be made in light of God. What kind of decisions?
•	where to live
•	where to work
•	where to go to school
•	where to go for recreation
•	where to worship
•	who to marry
•	who to fellowship with
•	who to date
•	what movies and TV programs to watch
•	what to wear and how to dress
Every decision we make in life should be made by considering God, by considering the impact it will have on our spiritual growth and testimony for Him. Lot failed to do this; we must not. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 47–48). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verses 12-13
Abram lived where he could prosper spiritually; Lot lived where he could prosper within the world, where he could secure the world’s possessions and enjoy its bright lights and pleasures. Abram continued his pilgrimage of faith: he refused to settle down, moving all around the land of Canaan

 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 48). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

But this was not all: Lot decided to settle down, and the place he chose for a home site was the worst place of all, near Sodom. What would make Lot do this? Money, greed, business—wanting the pleasures and possessions of the earth. The cities were just what they are today: places where the biggest markets for business transactions are.
⇒	The cities had all kinds of markets for gold, silver, sheep, goats, camels, cattle, and other commodities. Lot, just as any businessman, needed these markets to keep his business flourishing and growing.
⇒	The cities had all kinds of pleasures and possessions. Lot and his family desired the bright lights, pleasures, and possessions of the world. (Evidence of this is Lot’s wife: she just could not break away from Sodom and its pleasures, even at the risk of losing her life [Ge. 19:15–26]).
⇒	The cities also offered the opportunity for worldly position, honor, and recognition. Lot would later seek position and honor from the world. This is indicated by the fact that Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom when judgment was about to fall upon Sodom. Sitting at the gate of a city was reserved only for city officials. The city gate was where city officials met to conduct the business of the city. At some point in time, Lot became a city official of Sodom (Ge. 19:1).
Now, what was wrong with Lot doing business within the cities of the land? Nothing. Abram, no doubt, transacted business within the cities of Canaan as well. He had to, for it was the only way he had to grow and increase his business holdings, and Scripture is clear: Abram had large holdings; he was very rich in gold, silver, and herds (Ge. 13:2). The wrong committed by Lot was this: he became part of the world. He not only lived in the world, he participated in its worldly pleasures and sins, its greed and wickedness. Lot moved right in with the worldly and ungodly of this earth.
 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 48). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verse 14-17
Note when God spoke to Abram: after he had separated from worldly Lot. But God knew Lot’s heart, that Lot craved the worldliness of this earth, the bright lights, position, possessions and pleasures he had seen in the cities. Did Abram know that Lot had a worldly heart, that he was lusting after the things of this world? Scripture does not say. Thus God had to stir Abram to separate from Lot so that God could bless Abram. Scripture declares that God does not pour out His blessing upon a believer when he is unequally yoked with a worldly person (see 2 Co. 6:14–18). Once Lot was separated from Abram, God could then speak to Abram and meet his need.
Thought 1. God’s presence and power are only available to those who are …
•	set apart—separated—from the world and the lust after its bright lights, pleasures, and possessions

•	set apart—separated—unto God, wholly given over to Him, to seeking Him and His promises Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 49). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Note how God rewarded Abram’s faith: by His Word, by a vision of His great promises. God gave Abram strong assurance, a glorious vision of the promises. God told Abram to lift up his eyes, to look as far as the eye could see, and to look in every direction: north, south, east, and west. Note that Lot had also lifted up his eyes and looked, but there was a vast difference in what the two men saw (v. 10). Lot and Abram both lifted up their eyes and looked:
⇒	Lot lifted up his eyes to the world, but Abram lifted up his eyes to the promised land.
⇒	Lot lifted up his eyes in self-sufficiency, but Abram lifted up his eyes in trust.
⇒	Lot lifted up his eyes with a selfish, greedy desire for gain; Abram lifted up his eyes with a giving, sacrificial desire for unity.
⇒	Lot lifted up his eyes from an uncommitted, worldly heart; Abram lifted up his eyes from a committed, spiritual heart.
c. Note the threefold reward given to Abram. This was the third time God reaffirmed His covenant with Abram.
1)	The reward of the promised land (v. 15. See note—Ge. 12:1c for discussion.)
2)	The reward of the promised seed (v. 15. See note—Ge. 12:2–3 for discussion.) Note that the seed, the descendents, of Abram are to number as the sand by the seashore. This simply means that the grains of sand are so many they cannot be numbered, so Abram’s descendents down through the ages will be so many they will not be able to be numbered.
3)	The reward of being able to claim the land (v. 17). Very simply, God told Abram to arise and walk throughout the land, throughout the length and breadth of it, and to claim every place his foot stepped. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 49–50). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verse 18

Stedfastness—Obedience: Abram’s faith continued on. Abram obeyed God and worshipped God. The idea is that he did just what God said: he moved about as a pilgrim, claiming the land wherever he went.
Note that Abram settled down for a while by the great trees of Mambre in Hebron. Mambre was the name of the man (an Amorite) after whom the area was named (see Ge. 14:13).
⇒	Note that Abram also built an altar in Hebron. This altar was both for worship and for a testimony to the surrounding people, a witness to the only living and true God.

1 Chronicles 29:1–9 (ESV) — 1 And David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the palace will not be for man but for the Lord God. 2 So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble. 3 Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God: 4 3,000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house, 5 and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the Lord?” 6 Then the leaders of fathers’ houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king’s work. 7 They gave for the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents of iron. 8 And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord, in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9 Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the Lord. David the king also rejoiced greatly. 
Acts 4:32–37 (ESV) — 32 Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. 33 And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. 34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold 35 and laid it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need. 36 Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, 37 sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.

Ge 13:8–9 Abraham; 1 Sa 25:14–31 Abigail; Es 10:3 Mordecai; Is 53:5 the suffering servant 
Genesis 13:8–9 (ESV) — 8 Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. 9 Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.” 
1 Samuel 25:14–31 (ESV) — 14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master, and he railed at them. 15 Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them. 16 They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 17 Now therefore know this and consider what you should do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such a worthless man that one cannot speak to him.” 18 Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys. 19 And she said to her young men, “Go on before me; behold, I come after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 20 And as she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them. 21 Now David had said, “Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good. 22 God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him.” 23 When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell before David on her face and bowed to the ground. 24 She fell at his feet and said, “On me alone, my lord, be the guilt. Please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant. 25 Let not my lord regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent. 26 Now then, my lord, as the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, because the Lord has restrained you from bloodguilt and from saving with your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal. 27 And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord. 28 Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the Lord, and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live. 29 If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the Lord your God. And the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling. 30 And when the Lord has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you and has appointed you prince over Israel, 31 my lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause or for my lord working salvation himself. And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”

            <Title>Meekness</Title>
            <Text>Meekness

5. Now the meek come in for attention (JB and REB have “gentle”). Meekness is another word for self-effacement. We should not miss the point that in all three of the opening beatitudes the truth is brought out that the follower of Jesus does not aggressively insist on his own rights but displays genuine humility. Meekness is not to be confused with weakness: the meek are not simply submissive because they lack the resources to be anything else. Meekness is quite compatible with great strength and ability as humans measure strength, but whatever strength or weakness the meek person has is accompanied by humility and a genuine dependence on God. True meekness may be a quality of the strong, those who could assert themselves but choose not to do so. The strong who qualify for this blessing are the strong who decline to domineer. Self-assertion is never a Christian virtue; rather, it is Christian to be busy in lowly service and to refuse to engage in the conduct that merely advances one’s personal aims.

The reward of the meek is that they will inherit the earth (cf. Ps. 37:11). The verb points to firm possession; clearly there is no thought here of inheriting on the death of a testator or the like. There may be a reference to the psalm that contrasts the wicked, who “will be no more,” with the meek, who “shall possess the land” (Ps. 37:10–11). The sense in which they will do this is not obvious. Tolstoy and others have spoken of “the terrible meek” apparently because there are so many of the downtrodden that in the end the strong are not able to budge the inert mass and accomplish what they want to get done. But it is impossible to think that Jesus’ meaning is anything like that. Rather, the thought is eschatological; Jesus is looking forward to the coming of the messianic kingdom. In the end it is the meek, not the self-assertive, who will have a place in God’s kingdom. It has often been pointed out that the future in this and the following verses indicates certainty and not simply futurity. Morris, L. (1992). The Gospel according to Matthew (p. 98).

            <Title>Three things are said about Lot’s capture by the</Title>
            <Text>Three things are said about Lot’s capture by the invaders:
1) Lot was actually living in Sodom, within the wicked city itself. From the first, Lot had been attracted by the bright lights and business opportunities which the city offered, and he had moved to the beautiful valley that surrounded the city: he had “pitched his tent toward Sodom” (Ge. 13:12–13; see notes—Ge. 13:5–18 for more discussion). But note where Lot was now living: in Sodom. He had moved right in among the wicked people of the city; he had become a part of the worldly environment. He was participating in the bright lights, pleasures, and greed of the people.
2) Lot lost all his possessions: his home, property, livestock, and money—all his wealth. Keep in mind that Lot had chosen the Jordan Valley to establish his livestock business because of the fertile pasture land and heavy population that assured a market for his livestock. (See note, pt. 1—Ge. 13:12–13 for more discussion.) But now the invading army plundered, taking all the goods of the city. Lot was left with nothing, nothing but the clothes on his back.
3) Lot was a prisoner of war. He was now a slave: he was being deported, being taken to some foreign land to serve as a slave to the invaders.&quot;
Link
&quot;Eight facts about the war are mentioned.
a. The invaders were four kings from Babylon and Elam (Persia) (v. 1).&quot;
Link
&quot;The defenders were five kings of Palestine, apparently the five major kings of the land (v. 2). Note that each city had a king: the government of the day was apparently what is known as city-states, that is, a city and its surrounding territory was governed by some ruler or some appointed body of persons.
c. The battlefield was the valley of Siddim, the Salt Sea (Dead Sea) (v. 3). It was there that the armies faced off against one another. And note: the war was not a small battle. It involved much of the known world of that day: Elam (Persia), Babylon, perhaps Assyria, and some king of nations, some man who ruled over several nations—all joining an alliance against Palestine.
d. The cause for the war was a revolt by the Palestinian states against the rule of a foreign government (v. 4). Chedorlaomer, the king of Elam or Persia, had conquered Palestine some twelve years before. For twelve long years he&quot;
Link
&quot;had enslaved and taxed Palestine. Now, in the thirteenth year, the people of Palestine had had enough. When the time came for the taxes to be paid, they refused and rebelled. This left Chedorlaomer with no choice, for he had to protect his tax base and the trade routes that ran through Palestine down into Egypt and northern Africa.
e. The brilliant strategy of the invaders is graphic. The following year (the fourteenth year) the Elamite army marched against the five Palestinian kings who had led the revolt. The author builds up the suspense of the battle. The prime target of the invading armies was Sodom and Gomorrah. The invaders took a wide sweep around the two cities, conquering the border cities first. One by one, the invaders drew the net ever so tightly around Sodom and Gomorrah. Looking at a map, the reader can see how the invaders took a wide sweep to the east and south; then swept up the southwest; then they swept back up to the northeast (which is by the western side of the Dead Sea). The final thrust was downward upon Sodom and Gomorrah. Note how the battles took place in various cities, one by one. Just imagine how the citizens of each rebel city would buzz about, sharing nervously the news of the fall of their neighboring cities—how the suspense and fear would build over the news of battle after battle and defeat after defeat …
•The Rephaims were defeated at Ashteroth-Karnaim (v. 5)
•The Zuzims were conquered at Ham (v&quot;
Link
&quot;f. The major battle was fought in the valley of the Salt Sea, that is, the Dead Sea (v. 8).
g. The kings of Sodom and Gomorrah suffered a humiliating defeat (vv. 10–11). The author specifically mentions what happened to these two kings, pointing out an unusual fact. They fled and hid out in the tar pits—bitumen or asphalt pits—while the rest of their army fled into the surrounding mountains (v. 10). The Hebrew word for “they fell” can either mean to perish or to lower and humiliate oneself. The king of Sodom was still alive in verse 17, thus the meaning must be that the two kings were defeated in battle, utterly debased and humiliated. They had to crawl and hide out in the tar pits of the area. The valley of the Salt Sea (Dead Sea) was full of bitumen pits from which tar or asphalt was taken in ancient days.
In taking time to share this fact, the author was probably pointing toward the future judgment of the two cities that were so infested with the disease of immorality, the basest sort of immorality, that of homosexuality (Ge. 19:1f; see Ro. 1:26f).
h. Lot was taken captive (v. 12). Remember, Lot was the son of Abram’s brother, the son whom Abram had taken under his care to rear when his brother had died. Lot was, therefore&quot;

            <Text>3 (14:13) Faith—Preparation: the wise preparation of courageous faith. As stated above, God made rare promises to
Abram and Abram believed God, even against all odds. Abram knew the odds, and he had anticipated the dangers that lay ahead of him as he laid hold of the promises of God (the promised land). No person lays claim to a land that is occupied by others without facing opposition. Struggle after struggle was to confront Abram. But note: he had prepared ahead of time. He had joined hands with others, made a covenant—a treaty—for mutual protection. The treaty was with the Amorite, Mamre, and his two brothers, Eshcol and Aner. Note that the valley where Abram and Mamre were living was named after Mamre.
Thought 1. What a lesson for all believers! As we journey through life laying hold of the promises of God, we are confronted with struggle after struggle. Our only hope is to join hands with other believers for mutual protection. But we must prepare ahead, developing Christian fellowship and ministry. Then when the struggles come, we will know others who can stand with us, know them well enough that we can call upon them. This takes preparation, preparation ahead o&quot;

12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ec 4:12). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 6:2). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

The general principle is supplied in Galatians 6:2: Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.

Notice the assumption which lies behind this command, namely that we all have burdens and that God does not mean us to carry them alone. Some people try to. They think it a sign of fortitude not to bother other people with their burdens. Such fortitude is certainly brave. But it is more stoical than Christian. Others remind us that we are told in Psalm 55:22 to ‘cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you’, and that the Lord Jesus invited the heavy-laden to come to Him and promised to give them rest (Mt. 11:28). They therefore argue that we have a divine burden-bearer who is quite adequate, and that it is a sign of weakness to require any human help. This too is a grievous mistake. True, Jesus Christ alone can bear the burden of our sin and guilt; He bore it in His own body when He died on the cross. But this is not so with our other burdens—our worries, temptations, doubts and sorrows. Certainly, we can cast these burdens on the Lord as well. We can cast all our care on Him, since He cares for us (1 Pet. 5:7, av). But remember that one of the ways in which He bears these burdens of ours is through human friendship.

A striking example of this principle is given us in the career of the apostle Paul. At one stage in his life he was terribly burdened. He was worried to death over the Corinthian church and in particular about their reaction to a rather severe letter which he had written to them. His mind could not rest, so great was his suspense. ‘We were afflicted at every turn’, he wrote, ‘—fighting without and fear within.’ Then he continued: ‘But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus’ (2 Cor. 7:5, 6). God’s comfort was not given to Paul through his private prayer and waiting upon the Lord, but through the companionship of a friend and through the good news which he brought.

Human friendship, in which we bear one another’s burdens, is part of the purpose of God for His people. So we should not keep our burdens to ourselves, but rather seek a Christian friend who will help to bear them with us. Stott, J. R. W. (1986). The message of Galatians: Only one way (pp. 157–158).

⇒Lot had taken the best land for himself, leaving Abram to fend for himself on the less desirable land. (See outline and notes—Ge. 13:5–18 for more discussion.) Abram could have allowed harsh feelings to develop against Lot for having wronged him.
⇒Lot was worldly, attracted by the bright lights, pleasures, and possessions offered by the ungodly of the cities. Abram could have responded by saying that Lot was getting what he deserved, that God’s judgment was falling upon Lot because of his worldliness.
⇒Lot had been captured by a strong enemy, a large force of invaders. Humanly, it was impossible for Abram to rescue Lot.
Note this striking fact: Abram refused—absolutely refused—to fall back upon these excuses. He did not even consider them. When he heard that his brother (spiritual brother) was taken captive, Abram immediately acted. &quot;

&quot;Thought 1. Scripture is clear: when a brother is enslaved, we are to rescue him. No matter what the enslavement is, we are to be courageous: we are to arise and go after our brother. We are to do all we can to free him from his enslavement, from …

&quot;Thought 1. We must always act with compassion and unselfishness. The reason is clear: God has made it possible for people—no matter what they have done—to be freed and fully restored through Christ.&quot;

•all the people: the men, the women, and the children
•all the goods and possessions
Abram could have kept everything for himself, but unselfishly, he returned everything to the people. And note: they were unbelievers, the terrible, immoral sinners of Sodom. Yet Abram freed them and returned their goods. Why? Because Abram knew that God has always had compassion upon man and acted&quot;</Text>

            <Title>The significant fact about Melchizedek is that he</Title>
            <Text>The significant fact about Melchizedek is that he was a priest of God, the Most High God (El Elyon). Melchizedek was representing God and bringing the honor of God to Abram. Melchizedek’s purpose was not to heap worldly praise and honor upon Abram, but to heap godly praise and honor.&quot;
Link
&quot;Honor, Godly—Tithing: the godly honor was represented in Melchizedek, the king of Salem or Jerusalem. (Salem is just a shorter name for Jerusalem, see Ps. 76:2.) Salem had not been attacked by the invading army so far as the record shows. But Melchizedek knew that the Eastern invaders could have returned to conquer not only Salem but all of Canaan. Thus, Abram had eliminated the danger of attack by defeating the invaders from the East. For this, Melchizedek was very thankful and appreciative. So he, too, gathered up his entourage and came out to express his deep gratitude for the great victory won by Abram.&quot;
Link
&quot;Godly honor met the spiritual needs of Abram and his men (v. 19). How? The priest did the greatest thing he could do: he prayed for Abram and blessed him (v. 19).
⇒He praised and blessed the name of the Most High God
⇒He witnessed to the thousands who were with Abram
Remember, there were thousands of unbelieving Canaanites present when Melchizedek honored Abram: the prisoners who had been freed by Abram, and the soldiers of the Amorite chiefs who had joined forces with him. (see Ge. 14:13, 24.) Note the blessing of Melchizedek:&quot;
Link
&quot;Thought 1. What a unique opportunity to witness for God! And Melchizedek did not let the opportunity pass. He bore testimony to the Most High God before both the prisoners and the army. What a challenge to us: to be faithful in witnessing, to grasp every opportunity we can to proclaim the salvation of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;

&quot;worldly honor tempted Abram to compromise: to keep what he had gained for himself. &quot;</Text>

            <Text>Abram Rescues Lot
14 In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, 2 these kings made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 3 And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). 4 Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 6 and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness. 7 Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar. 

8 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim 9 with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five. 10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country. 11 So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way. 12 They also took Lot, the son of Abram’s brother, who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way. 

13 Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram. 14 When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. 15 And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. 16 Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people. 
Abram Blessed by Melchizedek
17 After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.) 19 And he blessed him and said, 
		“Blessed be Abram by God Most High, 
Possessor of heaven and earth; 
	20 	and blessed be God Most High, 
who has delivered your enemies into your hand!” 
And Abram gave him a tenth of everything. 21 And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.” 22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, 23 that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ 24 I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.”

            <Text>What, then, shall we do with the term Hebrew here and elsewhere in the OT? It occurs thirty-three times in the OT. With the exception of Gen. 14:13 and Jon. 1:9, these references fall into three groups: (1) the time of Joseph and Moses while the Israelites are in Egypt; (2) Saul’s wars against the Philistines; (3) the laws dealing with the emancipation of the “Hebrew” slave (Exod. 21:2–6; Deut. 15:12–18; Jer. 34:9, 14). This term is frequently used by a non-Israelite when speaking to or about an Israelite (an Egyptian speaking, 5 times: Gen. 39:14, 17; 41:12; Exod. 1:16; 2:6; a Philistine speaking, 5 times: 1 Sam. 4:6, 9; 13:19; 14:11; 29:3). Conversely, eight times the term is used by an editor (or by an Israelite himself) to distinguish an Israelite from a foreigner (Gen. 40:15; 43:32; Exod. 1:15; 2:11, 13; 1 Sam. 13:3, 7 [?]; 14:21). Clearly, then, the word Hebrew is used primarily as an ethnic term in the OT.

There seems to be no good reason to depart from this understanding of Hebrew in Gen. 14:13. Accordingly, Heb. ʿiḇrî is the gentilic of ʿē ḇer, and here it distinguishes Abram from other residents already living in Canaan. He is a descendant of Eber of the line of Shem. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17 (p. 405). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

            <Text>Others think it is an ethnic term, connected with Eber, the last ancestor in the line of Shem before the earth is divided (10:21–25). The latter is the preferred meaning based on the following: (1) The form (ʿiḇrî) consists of ʿeḇer + a gentilic î, like Israeli or Israelite from Israel; (2) this form is appropriate with the proper name Eber, not with ʿapiru; (3) the term always occurs in opposition to other ethnic groups, especially the Egyptians and Philistines; (4) though landless, the other characteristics of Abraham do not fit the ʿapiru. The Bible ascribes the term only to Abraham and his descendants to show that they are the legitimate descendants of Shem through Eber. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001).

tenth. This is a one-time tithe of the booty (cf. Num. 31:25–41), not an annual tithe to the priest (cf. Lev. 27:30–33; Num. 18:21). Tithing is an old and ancient practice in the biblical world (see 7:2). Kedorlaomer’s tribute is paid as a tithe to the Lord! With the institution of monarchy, a greedy king demands the annual tithe along with the priest (1 Sam. 8:15, 17). The text does not suggest that Melchizedek has come to collect his tithe, though some foist that suggestion upon it. Melchizedek celebrates Abraham as God’s warrior and blesses him. Abraham recognizes Melchizedek as the legitimate priest and king of his God.

16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.


2 Corinthians 12:7–10
7 So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. 

8 Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me.
 
9 But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

The tithes paid by Abraham, the ancestor of Israel and, therefore, of the Aaronic priesthood, to Melchizedek (Gn. 14:20), and his receiving the blessing of this priest-king (Gn. 14:19), signify in Heb. 7:1ff. that Melchizedek’s priesthood was infinitely superior to the Aaronic or levitical priesthood. Why Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek is not explained in Gn. 14:18–20.

            <Text> COMA questions for Old Testament narrative

Context
What has happened so far in the narrative? Have there been any major events, characters or themes?
What has happened just prior to the section you are reading?
Lot gets captured and enslaved in a war between two alliances of kings
Abram rescues Lot
Abram meets and receives blessing from Melchizedek. In addition, he offers a tithe to Melchizedek. 
Abram rejects the king of Sodom
Observation
What do you learn about the main characters in this  section? How does the author describe them? How do they describe themselves?
Yahweh
Continues to guide and reassure Abram
Describes himself as Abram's shield.
The metaphor depicts God as one who protects his warrior.
Describes himself as Abraham's great reward
Abraham’s reward for faithful service is much greater than the tarnished booty the king of Sodom offered.
Abraham’s greatest treasure, however, is having the Lord himself as his God (Gen. 17:8; Deut. 10:21).
Called ‘LORD GOD’
Sovereign means “master, lord.”
Reveals Himself as the LORD
God keeps his promises (Gen. 25:7–8), giving assurance to the patriarchs that he will keep his promises to their descendants.
Abram
He experienced doubt and sought reassurance. 
For the first time, Abram expresses the difficulty of keeping blind faith in an uncertain future fulfillment of the promise when his present experience calls that possible fulfillment into question.
Eliezer of Damascus 
Abraham’s chief servant, and his adopted heir before the birth of Ishmael and Isaac
The custom whereby a childless couple could adopt someone from outside as an heir is very well attested during c. 2000–1500 bc; such an adoptive heir had to take second place to any subsequent first-born son.
The Nuzi tablets (mid-second millennium b.c.) give some evidence that in Abraham’s culture a childless man could adopt someone to be the guardian and heir of his estate as compensation for the person’s performing the duties of a son. If a son was subsequently born, the adopted man could not disinherit the natural son.

Abraham's descendants
The future Israelite nation
They will be in Egypt 400 years, part of which includes brutal slavery.
Will be used by God as judgment against the Amorites
Amorites
Amorites (see 10:16; 14:13) here functions as a synecdoche for the ten nations listed in 15:19–21.
it is not until the nations become totally saturated with iniquity that God dispossesses them (Lev. 18:24–28; 20:23).
So also he does not send the Flood until the earth is fully corrupt (Gen. 6:5, 12), and he does not destroy Sodom and Gomorrah until he has satisfied himself that not even a quorum of righteous are left in the city. 
Israel’s conquest and settlement of Canaan is based on God’s absolute justice, not on naked aggression. 
Later, when Israel’s iniquities have become full, God will drive even his elect nation from the land (Deut. 28:36–37; 2 Kings 24:14; 25:7).
Is time or place significant in the events that happen in the passage?
God provides the boundaries of the land promised to Abram
Is there a conflict or high point in the passage?
The high point is God cutting of the covenant 
Do you think there is a main point or theme in this section of the story?
The theme of divine promise and blessing
What surprises are there?

Meaning
Are there any ‘editorial’ comments from the author about the events in the narrative? How do these comments illuminate what is happening?
And he ﻿believed in the Lord, and He ﻿accounted it to him for righteousness. 15:6
The narrator’s theological comment in 15:6 assures his audience that Abraham complains out of his faith, not his unbelief.
believed [ʾāman]. The Hebrew is better translated “trusted.” Abraham considers God true, reliable, and trustworthy. Abraham is the father of all who believe (see Rom. 4:11; Gal. 3:7).
Faith is an attitude of trust that shows itself through the people’s obedience to God. 
Noah demonstrates faith in God by his willingness to believe God’s promise of protection through the coming flood and his obedience in constructing the ark in accordance with God’s instructions (Gen 6). 
Abraham’s trust in God’s covenant promises was validated as “righteousness” (Gen 15:6) and was ratified on Mount Moriah when he was willing to sacrifice Isaac, the son of the promise (Gen 22:1–19). 
Moses displayed faith in God through his commitment to serve as the instrument of God’s provision of freedom and deliverance, leading Israel out of Egyptian captivity (see the book of Exodus). 
The prophets expressed faith in God through their belief in the word of Yahweh that they had received and their willingness to proclaim that word to the kings of Israel and Judah, as well as to surrounding nations,
Aman, “Believe.” Genesis 15:6 says Abram “believed in Yahweh” (he'emin beyhwh) and that was “reckoned as righteousness”. The Hebrew verb for “believed” is aman, the same root word as amen (“truly”) and emeth (“truth”). The basic idea behind the root aman is the concept of certainty and dependability. In Genesis 15:6, the verb appears in the hiphil (causative) conjugation and means “trust” or “believe.” Normally the hiphil has a causative sense and would mean “cause to be certain.”
Credited. The expression means that God reckons Abraham’s faith in the promise as righteousness.
righteousness. The word refers to behavior that serves the community according to God’s norms (see 6:9; 7:1)
On the same day the Lord ﻿made a covenant with Abram, saying: 15:18
Made = cut
A unilateral covenant in that God passed through the pieces
Covenant = a binding promise
Does someone in the narrative learn something or grow in some way? How? What does this person learn?
How does the passage point forward to what God is going to do in the future? Does it prophesy or anticipate Jesus Christ in some way?
The simple statement of Abram’s faith in Yahweh from Gen 15:6 provided the Apostle Paul with a fundamental ot example of justification by faith in Jesus apart from the Mosaic law
Paul’s use of Abram in Gal 3–4 puts more emphasis on the promise of blessing flowing through Abram (Gen 12:3; 18:18), which he relates to the salvation brought by faith in Jesus Christ.
In Romans 4 we read that Abraham, the forefather of the Jews, the exemplar of righteousness, was justified before God by faith, not by earning any sort of merit through his earthly deeds
James’ appeal to the example of Abraham is merely an acknowledgement that genuine faith like Abraham is demonstrated through actions, not simply the verbal assent that one believes (compare Jas 2:19). 
Paul, on the other hand, emphasizes that Abraham’s righteousness was given by God, not earned from God, making a distinction between the gospel of Christ and the law of Moses as two separate options for attempting reconciliation with God
How could you sum up the meaning of this passage in your own words?

Application
How does this passage challenge your understanding about who God is and what he is like?
God is the protector of His faithful people.
God is sovereign over history.
God reveals his covenant with Abraham and his descendants in progressive stages.
God will remain faithful to his promises, despite our weaknesses.
Is there some attitude or behaviour you need to change?
I must be willing to live by faith in God's promises through the struggles of life.
As you go through life, don’t let your feelings—real as they are—invalidate your need to let the truth of God’s words guide your thinking.
I must be willing to put to death the old kings and gods in my life
Please read Genesis 15 and answer the following questions:
How did God speak to Abram and what promise did He give him (v1)?
God spoke to Abram in a vision
He promised Abram a great reward
What problem did Abram have regarding God’s promise, and what solution did he propose (vv 2,3)?
Abram struggled with being childless and proposed that Eliezer be his heir
Picking up on the lack of specifics, Abram asks explicitly about the promise of an heir to inherit everything God has blessed him with. His faith is initially eclipsed by his doubt over the apparent delay in fulfilling that promise (Gen 15:2–3)
What did God say about Abram’s solution (v4)?
God rejected Abram’s solution and reaffirmed Abram that he would conceive an heir.
Yahweh responds by promising him that his own flesh-and-blood son will be his heir and eventually his descendants will be as numerous as the stars (Gen 15:4–5)
What promise did God repeat to Abram in vv 5,7, and where else have we read this promise?
God reaffirms the nation and land promise
Genesis 12:1-2; 13:14-17
How did Abram respond to this promise (v6)?
He believed/trusted God
Name at least two places where Gen. 15:6 is referred to in the New Testament.
Romans 4:9,22; Galatians 3:6; James 2:23
Special Assignment: What lessons does the New Testament teach based on Gen. 15:6? Some people claim this proves Abram was justified by faith alone without obedience. Had Abram obeyed God before this? What is the proper conclusion?
Despite his faith, what request did Abram make of God (v8)?
He requests additional reassurance from God
Abram asks for tangible proof that the land will, in fact, become his.
What did God tell Abram to do to prepare for the revelation God intended to give (vv 9- 11)? (Think: Do some research to determine the significance of this act in vv 9-21.)
He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”
What did God predict would happen to Abram’s descendants (vv 13,14)? (Think: How was this fulfilled?)
they will be afflicted for four hundred years but afterwards leave their enslavement with great possessions
This was fulfilled in Egypt
What would happen to Abram’s descendants in the fourth generation (v16)? (Think: What is the significance of the expression “the iniquity of the Amorites is not complete”)
They will return to Canaan 
The iniquity of the Amorites = 
What covenant did God make with Abram (vv 18-21)?
He made a covenant to give Canaan to Abraham's descendants

1 After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: “Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.” 

2 But Abram said, “O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” 
3 And Abram said, “Behold, you have given me no offspring, and a member of my household will be my heir.” 
4 And behold, the word of the Lord came to him: “This man shall not be your heir; your very own son shall be your heir.” 
5 And he brought him outside and said, “Look toward heaven, and number the stars, if you are able to number them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” 
6 And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness. 

7 And he said to him, “I am the Lord who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.” 
8 But he said, “O Lord God, how am I to know that I shall possess it?” 

9 He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” 
10 And he brought him all these, cut them in half, and laid each half over against the other. But he did not cut the birds in half. 
11 And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.
 
12 As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold, dreadful and great darkness fell upon him. 
13 Then the Lord said to Abram, “Know for certain that your offspring will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there, and they will be afflicted for four hundred years. 
14 But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward they shall come out with great possessions. 
15 As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age. 
16 And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.” 

17 When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces. 
18 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your offspring I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates, 
19 the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,

            <Title>Leadership Ministries Notes</Title>
            <Text>Introduction: fear and disappointment—for some reason these two emotions gripped the soul of Abram.
⇒	Did Abram have a close call—was he almost killed—in the attack against the invading army from the east? (See outline and notes—Ge. 14:1–16 for discussion.)
⇒	Did Abram fear retaliation from the four nations whose army he had defeated?
⇒	Was Abram questioning (regretting) the unusual decision he had made: not to follow the law of conquest which gave all the spoils to the victor? If he had kept the spoils, he could have probably secured the loyalty of the rescued prisoners, mobilized them under his rule, and taken control of the promised land, at least much of it. He could have possibly become king himself, king of the city-states he had rescued. Could it be that he had missed God’s way for him to secure the promised land? Had he missed his opportunity to possess the land? After all, he had been in the land of Canaan for over ten years and he owned no land, and even more disappointing, he had no children. Not even a single child had been born to him. None of God’s promises had even begun to be fulfilled. Perhaps God had meant for him to secure the loyalty of the rescued people and take possession of whatever land he could.
⇒	Was Abram just feeling emotionally and physically drained after the excitement of the battle? The strain of duty after a big event always leaves a person emotionally and physically drained. At such times, the person often wonders and questions things. Was Abram just so drained, so let down, that he began to feel uneasy and to question whether he would ever have a son (the promised seed) and inherit the promised land? After all, he was living in a lawless and dangerous area, and it had been over ten years since he had arrived in Canaan. He and Sarah were aging, and not a single promise from God had yet been fulfilled. Was there a chance—did he fear—that he had misread and misunderstood the promises of God?
⇒	Did Abram just fear that he would forever be childless and never inherit the land?
Scripture does not say why Abram feared and felt disappointment. Perhaps all of these possibilities played a part in the emotional strain he was experiencing.
Note the words “after these things”—after the battle—Abram’s soul was gripped by fear and disappointment, so much so that God gave Abram a vision and reassured him of the great promises of God

1)	“Abram, do not fear.” This is the first time we find this great encouragement in the Bible. Note who speaks the words: God. There is all the difference in the world who the speaker is. Too often, we look to businesses and governments to ease our fears, but only God can truly remove the great fears of life: the fears …
•	for safety and security
•	of sickness and death Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 64). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


2)	“Abram, I am your shield.” A shield protected and defended a person. (See note 3, Shield—Ge. 15:1 for more discussion.) Note that God Himself is the believer’s shield: his protector and defender. God Himself shielded Abram …
•	from being hopelessly discouraged and giving up
•	from denying the faith and the promises of God
•	from being defeated by the enemies of life
•	from losing his soul to the spiritual enemies of God
•	from losing heart in the face of weakness, temptation, and trial
Thought 1. God and God alone can shield the believer throughout life. This is the promise of His Word. It was the promise to Abram, and it is the promise to us. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 65). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

3)	“Abram, I am your great reward.” Again, God Himself is the believer’s reward: his provision, supply, and source. Abram had returned all the goods—valuables and gold, livestock and possessions—to the people he had rescued. All the wealth was rightfully his by the law of conquest, but he had returned all and kept nothing for himself. Despite his large herds and his wealth as a businessman, he only leased land for his herds to graze upon. He owned no land, not even a small plot. Was he to ever possess it? Was he to ever bear a son to be his heir?
God assured Abram that he would be rewarded, richly rewarded.
⇒	Abram was to be rewarded by God Himself. He had no need that God was not going to meet.
“But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Mt. 6:33).

“The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot” (Ps. 16:5).

⇒	Abram was to be rewarded with God Himself, with all that God is within Himself—within His very nature. Abram was to receive God’s very nature, be conformed to His image, possess the love, joy, peace—all the fruit of God’s Spirit—which are the most valuable possessions a person can have.

Apparently Abram was almost in despair. In his mind, God’s promises were not being proven, not taking effect, not being fulfilled in his life. The unfulfilled promises of God were straining his thoughts and weighing heavily upon his heart. Note that Abram states the case three times to God.
⇒	I am childless (v. 2).
⇒	You have given me no son, no seed (v. 3).
⇒	My heir is not my own son, but the steward of my household (v. 3).
Abram was wondering, questioning. As stated, he was apparently almost in despair. But note what happened.
b. God spoke to Abram to reassure him. God corrected Abram: the steward of his household would not be his heir, but a son would come from his own body to be his heir. The promised seed was sure, absolutely sure: the promise of God would be fulfilled. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 66). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. Just like Abram’s experience, emotions can fall apart; darkness can sweep over our souls; trials can sap our strength; temptation can cause us to question and doubt God’s promises. In fact, times do arise when we need a fresh experience with God, a brokenness, a deep sense of His presence, a special reassurance from His Word. It is in such moments of need that God always comes to us to meet our need, and the depth of the experience with God always matches our need. The experience of His presence and power, of His Word and assurance, are always just what we need. This was the case with Abram, and it is always the case with the genuine follower of God. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 66). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

c. Abram believed God’s Word: believed God and was counted righteous (v. 6). This is one of the most important verses found in all of Scripture. Its great importance is seen in that it is discussed at length in the New Testament (Ro. 4:1–25; Ga. 3:1–29; Js. 2:14–24). The verse covers the great doctrine of justification, the great teaching that a person can become right with God by faith. This verse above all others reveals a fact that man must heed: from the beginning of human history there has been only one way to get right with God: justification by faith. When a person believes God—truly believes—God takes that person’s faith and counts it as righteousness. This was true of Abram and the believers of old, and it is true of us today Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 66). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


Counted as righteous

This is the great problem of mankind: How can a man become righteous before God? The answer must be found, for no person can live with God unless he is righteous. This is the great message of this verse: it tells us exactly how we can become righteous before God.
Note the word counted or credited (hasab). It actually means counted and credited, reckoned and imputed. It is an accounting word. For example, when a person deposits his money in a bank, the bank credits the money to his account. When Abram deposited his faith with God—laid his life into the hands of God—God credited his faith as righteousness. But as stated, no person is righteous. When a person truly believes God, truly casts himself upon God, trusting God to take care of him, God does just that: God takes care of him. God counts him as righteous. He is not righteous, but God credits his faith as righteousness. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 67). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. Note a significant fact: the way of salvation is the same for all men throughout history, the same for Old Testament believers and for New Testament believers. We secure a right relationship with God in the very same way that Abram did: faith in the promised seed, the Savior of the world.  Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 67). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

How shall I know you will give me this land?

But note: the fear and disappointment of Abram had been so frightening that he asked God for more and more assurance (v. 8). He wanted his faith to be strengthened—so rooted and grounded—he would never again question God’s promises. Thus, he asked God for a specific sign that would absolutely confirm the promise (covenant) of the promised land.
c. God heard Abram’s request. God moved to give him a visible sign that would establish the covenant forever in Abram’s mind (vv. 9–11). What would do this? A human covenant: using a human covenant with which Abram was familiar, a covenant that was used by people of that day to seal contracts. If God established the promise of the promised land with a human covenant—with a contract agreement—Abram would understand exactly what God was doing. Again, remember: all this was taking place in a vision that God was giving Abram.
⇒	Note the animals used: an heifer, a goat, and a ram, all three years old, which meant they were grown or mature. Also used were a dove and a young pigeon (v. 9).
⇒	Note that the covenant ceremony involved cutting the larger animals into halves and laying each piece opposite each other with a walking path between them. The dove and pigeon were left whole and one laid at the end of one row and the other at the end of the other row. The idea of the covenant was this: each party entering the covenant (contract) was to walk down the path between the pieces of sacrificed animals. While walking, they were to declare this promise: if they failed to keep the covenant then they deserved the same fate as the animals (Je. 34:18–19). Just what happened between Abram and God will be seen in a few moments Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 68). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

e. God gave Abram a deep experience of His holy presence (v. 17). Now God appeared to Abram and completed the covenant ceremony. He had delayed His arrival so he could give Abram the dream foretelling the history of the promised seed and the promised land. But note how God appeared to Abram: God’s presence was symbolized in a smoking firepot with a blazing torch. God has often symbolized His presence by using fire:
⇒	God appeared to Moses in the burning bush (Ex. 3:1–6).
⇒	God appeared to Israel in a pillar of fire throughout the wilderness wanderings (Ex. 13:21).
⇒	God appeared as a consuming fire to Israel on Mt. Sinai (Ex. 19:16f).
⇒	God, in the person of the Holy Spirit, came upon the disciples of Christ as tongues of fire at Pentecost (Ac. 2:1–4).
Note that the firepot with the blazing torch passed down the path between the pieces of sacrificed animals. This symbolized God completing the covenant. And note: Abram had no part. God alone passed between the parts of the sacrificed animals. God alone was making promises to Abram and assuring the covenant with Abram. Abram was not making promises to God nor making a covenant with God. He—just like all other people—could never keep his promise and covenant with God, not perfectly. Therefore, if the covenant of the promised seed and the promised land was to ever be established and fulfilled, it had to be established by God and by God alone. The covenant had to be by grace and by grace alone. This is so critical to understand that it needs to be repeated: the covenant of the promised seed and the promised land was by grace and by grace alone.

Thought 1. The way to overcome the fears and disappointments of life is to hear and believe God’s Word, His wonderful promise to give us the promised land, to give us heaven itself. This is the very reason God saves us, to give us the promised land of heaven, the glorious hope of living together in fellowship with Him forever and ever. This hope—the hope of heaven—helps to erase fear and disappointment. For we know that whatever happens to us—even if someone kills our bodies—our souls will live on and on forever with God.

Righteousness Through Faith
21 But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. 22 This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference between Jew and Gentile, 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25 God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, m through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—26 he did it to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.

26 So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, 27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.

            <Text>Following God’s Promise

Setting the Stage
Theme. It’s only natural to have doubts after someone has promised us the same thing time and again but hasn’t followed through. It can be difficult to maintain patience in the wake of disappointed expectation. Inaction, whether real or perceived, can erode trust and confidence. Eventually, we need an incredible amount of assurance before we can accept that person’s word again.

In Genesis 15–16, Abram expressed this kind of doubt regarding God’s promise of a son. God’s promise remained unfulfilled, and Abram needed new reassurance from God. But even after God provided this reassurance, Abram and Sarai still hesitated to fully trust that He would keep His word. They came up with a plan to overcome Sarai’s barrenness and provide Abram with the son he longed for. Ultimately, they looked beyond the promise and took matters into their own hands.
Literary Context. The opening verses of Gen 15 indicate that Abram had lost his sense of confidence. Previously, Abram exhibited great faith in rescuing Lot and defeating several kings in battle (Gen 14:1–16). God recognized this faith and ensured Abram’s success, causing him to be victorious (Gen 14:20). Genesis 15 opens with God encouraging Abram to continue trusting in Him. God tells Abram, “I am your shield,” alluding to Abram’s military victory (Gen 15:1). Abram’s response, however, reveals a surprising amount of insecurity, especially given his recent battlefield success. Indicating his sense of doubt, Abram reminds God that he is still childless (Gen 15:2).

In earlier chapters, God had repeated His promise to Abram several times in different forms. He had originally promised to make Abram a “great nation” and to make his name great (Gen 12:1–3). He had also promised to give the land of Canaan to Abram’s offspring (Gen 12:7). Later, God promised Abram that his offspring would be as numerous as the “dust of the earth” (Gen 13:14–17). However, time had passed, and Abram and Sarai still lacked a child.

This delay caused Abram to doubt. He wondered if perhaps his servant, Eliezer, was supposed to be his heir and inherit the land God had promised him. Abram bluntly explained the problem to God: “Look, you have not given me a descendant” (Gen 15:3). God responded not with rebuke—although this would have been justified—but with reassurance. In repeating the promise yet again, God explicitly stated that Abram’s own son would be the heir (Gen 15:4). Abram responded by trusting in God (Gen 15:6), and God led Abram in a ritual confirming the covenant promise (Gen 15:9–20).

In Genesis 16, despite God’s confirmation, we find Abram again doubting that God would fulfill His promise. Sarai proposed that Abram take her servant, Hagar, and have children with her (Gen 16:2). Abram agreed, and Hagar conceived (Gen 16:3–4). Hagar’s pregnancy caused strife between her and Sarai, who sent Hagar away (Gen 16:5–6). God intervened, and Hagar returned to give birth to Ishmael (Gen 16:15) Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 15:1–16:15).

            <Title>Adventures in Faith</Title>
            <Text>&quot;This part of Abram’s story powerfully illustrates this lesson for us. Sensing delay, Abram voiced his concern about not yet having a son (Gen 15:2–3). God met Abram at the point of his need and responded to him in loving, tangible ways. He went to great lengths to provide Abram with the assurance he needed and to make His promise alive to Abram again. &quot;

&quot;And so too the Christian today, who seeks for assurance, can but go to Calvary where God seems to say, “There is the evidence of my love. If you can stand before Calvary and still doubt that I love you, still doubt that My Word is true, there is nothing else that I can possibly do for you.”
It must be impressed upon our minds that to ask for anything more than the simple word of the living God and Calvary is an insult to the Almighty and an example of our own doubt. When Abram asked God for further assurance, God gave him a picture of Calvary and confirmed His covenant. Today there is a&quot;

&quot;Today there is a great tendency for men not to be satisfied with the Word of God, but to look for other evidences, emotional experiences and disturbances, mental experiences and fleshly manifestations. Men want to have feelings and see signs and wonders and miracles, and have all sorts of strange dreams and visions and manifestations; but God says in effect, “All these things are dishonoring to Me.” &quot;
Link
&quot;He wants nothing more than for us to believe the record of His Word. Again we refer you to that passage in 1 John 5:9:
If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.
Let us be satisfied only with His Word and with the record of what He has done through Jesus Christ.&quot;
Link
&quot;Even when we sense delay and attempt to speed up God’s plan, He sovereignly brings about His promises according to His perfect timing.&quot;
Link
&quot;Just as we do when we think we cannot wait on God any longer, they took action on their own and produced an heir for Abram before God’s appointed time. Impatient decisions often lead to unforeseen consequences; the actions of Abram and Sarai brought a child into a situation of conflict and discord. Even before his birth, Ishmael was marked as one who would “live in hostility with all his brothers” (Gen 16:12).&quot;
Link
&quot;When our “thousand years” seem to be without end, God wishes for us to submit to His timing. When our patience is tried, Abram’s example helps us recall that “the Lord is not delaying the promise”; rather, He is simply bringing about His plan according to His flawless design (2 Pet 3:9).&quot;

            <Title>I Am Your Shield</Title>
            <Text>     “After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: ‘Fear not, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very great’” (Genesis 15:1). On the heels of a great military victory and grand recognition by Melchizedek, God commands Abraham to not allow himself to be overcome with fear. We know that Abraham succumbed to fear while in Egypt, but what circumstance might be tempting him to succumb at this point in time? Did have a close call with death during the most recent battle? Did he fear retaliation from the mighty powers he just defeated? Whatever the source, the Lord wants Abraham to depend upon him for safety and security. When God first called Abraham, He promised “I will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you I will curse” (Genesis 12:3). Melchizedek acknowledged that God delivered Abraham’s enemies into his hand. Now God reaffirms his commitment to protect Abraham and to shield him from all the dangers on his faith journey. God will not allow any enemies to defeat Abraham and nullify His promises. God will continually guide and reassure Abraham so that he will not give up and lose faith during difficult times. We must remember that God continues to protect, help, and strengthen us today. Instead of looking corporations and governments to ease our fears, we should adopt the attitude of David who wrote “the Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold” (Psalms 18:2).
     In addition to encouraging Abraham to continue to trust in Him, God promises to reward him greatly. The NIV translates the reward as being God Himself! Surely, God will reward Abraham with innumerable offspring and earthly treasures but there no greater treasure than having the Lord himself as God. A loving relationship with God is more precious than all of the temporal things of this life. Satan deceives people into thinking that fulfillment can be found apart from God. This leads to a life of emptiness and meaninglessness. As God’s children, each day we ought to rejoice in the Lord, no matter what life circumstances we find ourselves in. As an incentive to faithful service, we should reflect on the wonderful picture of ultimate fullness found in Revelation 21:3 - “And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, ‘Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away’”.

            <Text>Abraham’s response indicates that the reward God speaks of includes offspring: “O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?” (Genesis 15:2). Abraham goes on to express a sense of hopelessness. God’s delay has led Abraham to conclude that it looks like his chief servant, Eliezer, will end up being his heir. Waltke writes that there is “some evidence that in Abraham’s culture a childless man could adopt someone to be the guardian and heir of his estate as compensation for the person’s performing the duties of a son. If a son was subsequently born, the adopted man could not disinherit the natural son” (p. 241). It appears that Abraham has an alternate plan in place should he and Sarah fail to conceive a son. 
However, God reassured Abraham that he and Sarah will give birth to a son who will be his heir. In the midst of Abraham’s concern about not yet having a son, the Lord takes him outside during the night and tells him that he will produce as many offspring as the number of stars in the sky! Abraham’s response reveals the reason why he is called the father of the faithful: “And he believed the Lord, and he counted it to him as righteousness” (Genesis 15:6). Abraham paid more attention to God’s promise than to the fact that he and Sarah seemed to be rapidly passing the age of childbearing. Instead of focusing on Sarah’s barrenness, Abraham trusted God’s ability and willingness to bless them with a son. Paul describes Abraham’s faith as being “fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised” (Romans 4:21). Because of his faith, God declared Abraham righteous (or justified).
What was true of Abraham is true of us today. All of us have sinned and fallen short of God’s glory. We have created a debt with God that we can never repay. We all stand guilty in God’s courtroom. However, God promises to make us righteous through the work of Jesus Christ (Romans 3:21-25). God calls us to completely trust his promise and to fix our eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith (Hebrews 12:2). Cottrell provides a helpful analogy of justifying faith. It is not easy for a drowning person to relax and let a lifeguard to take control of him in order to pull him to safety. The drowning person will instinctly continue to try to save self, thus hindering the lifeguard’s efforts. In order to be saved, the person must allow the lifeguard to do what he is trained to do. In the same manner, if we want to be made righteous like Abraham, we must give up trying to save ourselves. Instead, we must fully accept and rest in God’s gracious promise of forgiveness through Jesus. The apostle Paul wrote, “So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ” (Galatians 3:26-27). It is through faith that we become Abraham’s seed and heir according to the promise God gave to him (Galatians 3:28-29).</Text>

            <Title>God Makes a Covenant</Title>
            <Text>Abraham believed God’s promise concerning offspring, but he asks for tangible proof that the land will become his (Genesis 15:8). What follows is a covenant ritual ceremony initiated by the Lord, who instructs Abraham to bring him a heifer, a female goat, a ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon. The ceremony proceeded with Abraham cutting the large animals in half, laying the pieces in opposite rows with the birds at opposite ends. Abraham falls into a divinely induced deep sleep at sunset and for the first time the Lord gives him the specific details of how he will possess the land of Canaan. God reveals to Abraham that himself will not possess it, but that his offspring will come into possession of the land after four hundred years of servitude in another land. Their return to Canaan will be the occasion of God judging the Amorites (representative of the ten nations listed in Genesis 15:19-21). When the Amorite culture becomes totally saturated with sin, God will use Abraham’s offspring to dispossess them of the land.
The ceremony reaches a high point when God appears to Abraham to finalize (cut) the covenant - “When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these pieces” (Genesis 15:17). Fire is often a symbol of the presence of God in Scripture (Exodus 3:1-6; 13:21; 19:16f; Acts 2:1-4). Here, God alone passes through the opposite rows of the sacrificed animals. God alone ratified His covenant with Abraham - this was a one-sided affair. By grace, God ‘obliges’ upon himself “to implement his promise of descendants, and especially of land, to Abram and to his descendants” (Hamilton, p.438). God goes great length to assure Abraham that He will definitely fulfill His promises. Likewise for us, at the cross of Calvary God gave us the greatest evidence of His love for us. With confidence, we can sing:
“To God be the glory, great things He has done, so loved He the 	world that He gave us His Son, who yielded his life our redemption to win, and opened the life-gate that all may go in” (To God Be The Glory, Fanny Crosby, 1872).

CPNIVC:RV1: II. 4:1–25—Abraham: Paradigm of Grace
An appeal to the life of Abraham is ideally suited for these purposes. He is indeed an object lesson of the main truth that Paul is explaining in these chapters, i.e., that God’s way of saving sinners is by grace, which means that we are justified by faith apart from works of law. Paul sees Gen 15:6 as a summary statement of this truth, and Romans 4 is basically an exposition of this verse.

CPNIVC:RV1: II. 4:1–25—Abraham: Paradigm of Grace
The content of this section seems to fall into six paragraphs, thus: Abraham was justified by faith apart from works (4:1–5). This is explained and confirmed by David in Ps 32:1–2 (4:6–8). Membership in Abraham’s family is by faith, not by circumcision; thus Abraham is the spiritual father of both believing Gentiles and believing Jews (4:9–12). The inheritance promised to Abraham comes by faith, not by law or works of law (4:13–17a). Abraham shows us what this justifying faith is like: it means giving glory to God and believing his promises (4:17b–22). Finally, all this is relevant for Christians today because anyone who believes like Abraham will be justified like Abraham (4:23–25).

As the focus of his faith, Abraham believed that God could miraculously restore both his and Sarah’s reproductive powers, a kind of figurative “resurrection from the dead” (4:19; Heb 11:11–12). He also believed that God had the power to raise Isaac from the dead if necessary, had the commanded sacrifice been completed (Heb 11:19). This sets the example for us, who are called on to believe that God raised Jesus from the dead (4:24), and to believe that he raises us from spiritual death in baptism (6:4; Col 2:12) and will raise us up from physical death on the last day (8:11, 23).

The more general language is probably used so that the concept of God’s omnipotent, creative call can be applied specifically to Abraham’s situation. As the object of Abraham’s faith, God is surely the one who names or speaks “of things in the remotest futurity …, with as much certainty as if they existed” (DeWelt, 66). When God said to Abraham, “I have made you a father of many nations” (Gen 17:5), he spoke of the future, as-yet-unborn legions of believers as though they already existed (MP, 328). Thus Abraham’s faith required him to believe that God controlled the future, and that he could and would bring into existence things which then existed for him only in the form of promises (Heb 11:10, 13–16). This is an example for us today, since we also must believe that God can and will one day call into being our not-yet-existing redeemed bodies and their eternal home in the new heavens and new earth.

Abraham’s hope was focused especially on the promise of countless descendants as recorded in Gen 15:5. After calling his attention to the multitude of stars in the heavens, God said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” At this time Abraham was between 75 and 86 years old (Gen 12:4; 16:16), and was already very conscious of the fact that he was still childless (Gen 15:2–3). But God reassured him, and Abraham believed (Gen 15:6).

Under such circumstances Abraham’s hope surely transcended all expectation based on natural processes (his own “works”); it was surely grounded in his faith that God could raise the dead and bring something out of nothing. Paul says it thus, that Abraham believed “against all hope,” yet “in hope.”

With it the idea would be that his faith was so strong that he did not pay any attention to the fact that he and Sarah appeared to be past the age of natural childbearing. He did not regard that as the deciding factor, and he did not allow it to weaken his faith (Lard, 147). All that mattered was God’s promise.

The first aspect of Abraham’s faith was that he gave glory to God.… The “glory” of God is his collective greatness, his total perfection, his manifested majesty (see 1:21). It cannot be increased; it can only be acknowledged and honored. We “give” glory to God by honoring him and by calling attention to everything that makes him great. The very essence of justifying faith is that it gives glory to God, since it is faith in God and in what he has done and promises to do, rather than a reliance upon ourselves and what we are able to achieve. Faith by its very nature puts ourselves in the background and turns the spotlight upon God.

CPNIVC:RV1: E. Faith Means Giving Glory to God and Believing His Promises (4:17b-22)
This verse sets forth the second aspect of Abraham’s faith: being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised. The verb means “to be fully persuaded, fully convinced, fully assured.” Toward what was this total confidence directed? Nothing less than the promises of God. Everything rested on whether or not God could keep his promises; Abraham believed that he could. He believed in the promises because he believed in the power, the “wonder-working power” of God, the power that is able to raise the dead and create from nothing (4:17).
Stott rightly points out that trusting in a person’s promises requires believing he has not only the power to keep them, but also the will to do so. I.e.

fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.


CPNIVC:RV1: E. Faith Means Giving Glory to God and Believing His Promises (4:17b-22)
The essence of justifying faith still follows the pattern of Abraham. God promises to save us by his grace through the work of Jesus Christ. We are called on to trust completely in this promise, believing in the loving intention of God and the forgiving power of the cross. This is not easy to do, just as it is not easy for a drowning person to relax and let a lifeguard hold on to him and pull him to shore. Instinctively the drowning person wants to grab and hold on, while thrashing and kicking and straining; but this only hinders and may even thwart the attempt to save him. If he really wants to be saved, he must relax and trust himself to the expertise and ability of the lifeguard. Likewise if we want to be saved, we must truly believe in God’s saving grace, which requires us to let go of our works and to rest in the certainty of his promises. Such faith enables us to stop anxiously examining our personal “workometer” in order to make guesses as to our salvation status. It enables us instead simply to fix our eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith (Heb 12:2).

Justification means to Paul God’s act of remitting the sins of guilty men, and accounting them righteous, freely, by his grace, through faith in Christ, on the ground, not of their own works, but of the representative law-keeping and redemptive blood-shedding of the Lord Jesus Christ on their behalf. (For the parts of this definition, see Rom. 3:23–26; 4:5–8; 5:18f.) Paul’s doctrine of justification is his characteristic way of formulating the central gospel truth, that God forgives believing sinners. Theologically, it is the most highly developed expression of this truth in the NT

The act of faith is here called believing “upon” (ἐπί, epi), which is not just bare intellectual assent to facts but also a surrender of the will and a commitment of the self to the person who is the object of faith, in this case God the Father. In the context of salvation Jesus is usually named as the object of faith (e.g., John 3:16; Acts 11:17; 16:31; Rom 3:22; Gal 2:16; 3:26), but not exclusively so (see Acts 16:34; Rom 4:5; Col 2:12)

It is clear that justifying faith must include faith in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead (10:9), in addition to faith in the atoning power of his death (3:25). Abraham’s faith is most appropriately paradigmatic for the former, since it was truly a faith that God is able to raise the dead (4:17, 19). Our faith is no different, except we now know that this holy resurrection power is ultimately displayed in the raising of Jesus (Eph 1:18–20; Col 2:12). In this light it is significant that the final fulfilment of God’s promise to Abraham was when he raised Jesus from the dead (Acts 13:32–34).

            <Text>17  The smoking fire pot and the flaming torch remind one of the smoke and fire that surrounded the summit of Mt. Sinai. Fire in the Bible is often a symbol of the presence of God. (We have already drawn attention to the close parallel in form between 15:7 and Exod. 20:2.)
That only something representing deity passes between the rows of flesh shows that this covenant is unilateral. If it were bilateral, we would have expected something representing Abram as well to pass through, as we saw in the Hittite text discussed above on vv. 9–11.
Of special significance here is the idea of Yahweh, represented by fiery symbols, passing between (ʿāḇar bēn) the rows of animal flesh. Here ʿāḇar is clearly a theophanic term. As such, the verb may be compared with two other important OT passages, Exod. 33–34 and Josh. 3–4. The first of these deals with the renewal of the covenant after the sin with the golden calf, and the second with the start and completion of Israel’s crossing the Jordan. The three references have the following items in common:
(1)	a proclamation of Yahweh’s name: Gen. 15:7; Exod. 34:5, 6; Josh. 3:9
(2)	something is “cut”: Gen. 15:18, a covenant; Exod. 34:4, tablets; Josh. 3:16, the waters of the Jordan
(3)	Yahweh’s appearance expressed through ʿāḇar: Gen. 15:17; Exod. 33:23; Josh. 3:11
(4)	a justification for the theophany: Gen. 15:8, to confirm to Abram that he will possess the land; Exod. 33:16; to demonstrate that Moses and his people have found Yahweh’s favor; Josh. 3:10, to convince the Israelites that there is among them a living God. (Note how each of these theophanies supplies knowledge for one who does not have that knowledge yet: “how am I to know?” [Gen. 15:8]; “for how shall it be known?” [Exod. 33:16]; “you shall know” [Josh. 3:10].)
(5)	a list of nations Yahweh is to expel (in the form of a promise): Gen. 15:18–21; Exod. 34:11; Josh. 3:10–11
(6)	each is in the context of a covenant, or covenant renewal.
We may deduce, then, that these three passages provide support for positing a covenant ritual ceremony which involved a theophany that was expressed by the verb ʿāḇar. It is not necessary to read into Gen. 15:17 any sanctions or self-curse to which Yahweh exposes himself. Rather, it is a confirmation of Yahweh’s promise of land to Abram’s descendants.
18–21  Animals are cut and now a covenant (binding promise) is cut. V. 18 provides the only instance of the word “covenant” in the chapter.
 Etymologically the Hebrew word for covenant, berîṯ, is associated with Akk. birītu, “clasp, fetter.” This etymology suggests that covenant, in the biblical sense, is not an agreement between two parties, but something that is imposed, an obligation. Nothing, however, in this chapter is imposed on Abram. He is free of any obligations. The only imposition or obligation that Yahweh lays upon anybody is upon himself, and that is the obligation to implement his promise of descendants, and especially of land, to Abram and to his descendants. For this reason Westermann has suggested, correctly, that berîṯ not be translated here as “covenant” but with something that captures the broader nuances of berîṯ. He offered, “On that day Yahweh gave Abraham the solemn assurance.…” Three elements in Yahweh’s covenant with Abram—unconditionality, an oath taken by deity, and gift—find their clearest parallel in the later covenant with David (2 Sam. 7). The major difference between the two is that the first is a promise of land (for all descendants) and the second is a promise of dynasty (for one family).

God obliges himself to give to Abram’s descendants the land of ten nations, all of which fall within the land of Canaan proper. The river of Egypt (see Num. 34:5; Josh. 15:4, which use naḥal instead of nāhār) is not the Nile but the modern Wadi el-Arish, the dividing line between Palestine and Egypt. The geographical extremes of the promise obviously extend beyond Canaan, witnessed especially by the phrase to the great river, the river Euphrates. In fact, only during the apogee of David’s reign, many hundreds of years later, was this promise actualized. But even then the empire was maintained only for a generation. By Solomon’s time cracks appeared in the empire, and portions of the empire rebelled and reclaimed their own land for themselves. Hamilton, V. P. (1990).

            <Text>Sarai and Hagar
16 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. 2 And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the Lord has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. 

3 So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife. 4 And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress. 5 And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the Lord judge between you and me!” 6 But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her. 

7 The angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. 8 And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.” 9 The angel of the Lord said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her.” 10 The angel of the Lord also said to her, “I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.” 11 And the angel of the Lord said to her, 
		“Behold, you are pregnant 
and shall bear a son. 
		You shall call his name Ishmael, 
because the Lord has listened to your affliction. 
	12 	He shall be a wild donkey of a man, 
his hand against everyone 
and everyone’s hand against him, 
		and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.” 
13 So she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, “You are a God of seeing,” for she said, “Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.” 14 Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered. 

15 And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. 16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

            <Title>Genesis 16 Lesson</Title>
            <Text>Please read Genesis 16 and answer the following questions:

How did Sarai propose to solve the fact that she was childless? (Think: What lesson can we learn from this about human efforts to modify God’s plans?)
She gave Hagar as wife to Abram to bear children for herself.
The tragedy of Gen 16 is that Sarai never prays to Yahweh to take away her barrenness (as Isaac does for Rebekah in Gen 25:21 and Hannah does for herself in 1 Sam 1:9–11). Rather, Sarai flatly announces that “Yahweh has prevented [her] from bearing children” and proposes a physical way around the problem (Gen 16:2).
What problem arose after Hagar conceived (v4)? 
Hagar began to despise Sarai
How did Sarai deal with the problem?
She treated Hagar harshly
Special Assignment: Muslims claim their religion came from Abraham through Ishmael. As we proceed, note what lessons we can learn about Ishmael’s relation to the promises God made to Abraham.
Who found Hagar and where was she?
An angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the desert
What did the angel tell Hagar to do?
To return to Sarai and submit to her

What promise did he give her? (Think: How was this prophecy fulfilled?)
He promised that the Lord is going to greatly multiply her offspring 
What name was given to Hagar’s child?
Ishmael 
What did the angel predict about the child’s nature and future? (Think: Again, does this refer primarily to Ishmael himself or to his descendants?)
That he will have a strong personality and experience conflict with everyone
What name was given to the place where this promise was given, and what does that name mean? (Think: What lessons can we learn from the meaning of this name?)
The well was called Beer-lahai-roi
The well of the Living One who sees me
“You are a God of seeing”
How old was Abram when Hagar’s son was born?
86 years old


COMA questions for Old Testament narrative

Context

What has happened so far in the narrative? Have there been any major events, characters or themes?
What has happened just prior to the section you are reading?

Observation

What do you learn about the main characters in this section? How does the author describe them? How do they describe themselves?
Abram
Acquiesces to Sarai’s request. He harkened to her voice. Does not see the long range implications/consequences of his decision
He experiences another momentary lapse in faith by being passive
Just like Adam in the Garden
Refuses to accept his responsibility by telling Sarai to deal with Hagar as she pleases.
Sarai
Displays faithlessness and  impatience with God’s promise. Instead of saying “God will give me baby when He’s ready” she says “I’ve got to have a baby because I’m ready!”
Shifts blame to Abram for the conflict between her and Hagar
Just like Eve in the garden
Her wounded pride and resentment caused her to lash out at Abram for doing what she herself had suggested.
Demonstrates harshness towards Hagar
Sara! wanted to build herself up through Hagar's offspring, but the result when Hagar became pregnant was that Sarai's self-esteem plummeted even further and her psychological misery became greater than before. Her pent-up feelings finally boiled over into rage.
Hagar
Demonstrates arrogance. Allows her pride of conceiving a child to show contempt towards Sarai, which was a big mistake.
Her own bulging tummy broadcast the success of Sarai's stratagem, but it also did something else. It silently proclaimed, &quot;I am a complete woman, and you are not.&quot;
Remains defiant and unrepentant through Sarai’s harsh treatment
Ishmael
Name means “God Hears”
Will be a wild donkey = metaphor for a strong, independent personality which will lead him into conflict with everyone
God
He looks after the oppressed, redeems human error and protects the wronged
God will protect the non-elect line of Abram’s descendants and will make them a great nation according to His original promise
Is time or place significant in the events that happen in the passage?
Abrams age at the time of Ishmael birth
Location of Hagar's encounter with the angel of the Lord
Abram had lived 10 years in Canaan by this time. For 10 years he and Sarai had tried to have children
Is there a conflict or high point in the passage?
Conflict between Sarai and Hagar after Hagar conceives
Conflict between Abram and Sarai
The angel of the Lord comes to Hagar
Do you think there is a main point or theme in this section of the story?
Theme of faithfulness despite delayed fulfillment of promise

What surprises are there?
Hagar seems surprised by the angelic encounter
She is the first person in the Bible to whom the angel of the Lord appears
She is the first woman in the Bible to whom God gives a promise
She is the only person in the OT to give God a new name.
Her meeting with the angel is the only time such an encounter with a woman results in a commemorative place name (Beer Lahai Roi)

Meaning

Are there any ‘editorial’ comments from the author about the events in the narrative? How do these comments illuminate what is happening?
Does someone in the narrative learn something or grow in some way? How? What does this person learn?
Hagar learned that God was looking after her, that He knows her situation and will protect her
Hagar learns of God’s plans for her future descendants
Sarai realizes that she proposed an unwise solution to her barrenness 
The immediate result is strife in the home, 
and its long-term consequence is the mixed blessing of numerous progeny that will inherit Hagar’s defiant spirit. 
Through synergism, the entire household loses: 
Sarah loses respect, 
Hagar loses a home, 
and Abraham experiences heartache for a lost wife and a rejected son. 
This natural generation brings hostility to future generations, not peace.
How does the passage point forward to what God is going to do in the future? Does it prophesy or anticipate Jesus Christ in some way?
God will fulfill part of His promise to Abram through Hagar
How could you sum up the meaning of this passage in your own words?

Application

How does this passage challenge your understanding about who God is and what he is like? 
God cares for those who have been rejected, who live on the fringe of society. Abram and Sarai pushed Hagar away, but God sought her out. 
God’s plan and promise are not invalidated by our failures. Abram and Sarai made a misstep on their journey of faith, but God was still true to His promise.
Sometimes, all God helps us to do is to survive. Divine intervention does not always deliver us from our troubles but simply helps us just to get by.
Is there some attitude or behaviour you need to change?
Instead of trying to independently help God accomplish his purpose through my impatience, I must demonstrate dependence on God’s promises
Waiting is not something most people do well, neither is it something experienced with great joy and gladness. Instead, we tell ourselves and one another to do something. &quot;Don't just sit there like a bump on a log. Take control!&quot;
Recognize the futility of humans trying to attain God's blessing and achieve God's purposes by their own machinations.
One implication of this story is that we often needlessly complicate our lives and tempt ourselves away from fully trusting God’s promises. Acting on our impatience is incompatible with surrendering fully to faith, as the negative implications of Abram and Sarai’s actions demonstrate
Following God in this earthly life requires walking behind and sometimes feels like plodding through a fog. We can see just far enough to know where to put our feet next, but we have no idea where we are going. We go by faith, not by sight.
Following the path God has for us does not mean that the journey will be one of ease and ready fulfillment but must Remember that God sees and pays attention to me through all the seasons of life. 
We can cope with a lot if we know we are not alone, if we trust that God sees, and sees us in our miserable plight. God was working in the life of Hagar. 
Her path was a difficult one, but the angel encouraged her to see that she could do it with God's hand on her. That made all the difference.

            <Text>


1.	Sara was childless &amp; became impatient: The causes of impatience
a.	An unfulfilled desire: Sara craved a child

Now Sarai Abram’s wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

b.	A mistaken thought: That God had kept Sara barren—that God’s promise did not include her
c.	A worldly, carnal suggestion: That Abram marry Sara’s maid, Hagar, &amp; bear children

2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

2.	Sara gave her maid to Abram: The terrible consequences of impatience
a.	A wrong plan &amp; method
b.	The collapse of faith &amp; patience

3 And Sarai Abram’s wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

c.	Sinful behavior: By Abram, Sara, &amp; Hagar
1)	Immorality, adultery, &amp; polygamy

4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

2)	Spite, malice, insolence, reproach, scorn, a haughty spirit
3)	Jealousy &amp; blaming others

5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the Lord judge between me and thee.

4)	Disturbed &amp; severed relationships

6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face.

3.	The Lord saved the maid, Hagar: The solution or answer to impatienceDS2

7 And the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

a.	A confrontation with God

8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.

b.	Receiving the promises of God
1)	A special heritage: An innumerable seed

9 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

2)	A special assurance: God will always hear &amp; meet the need of the distressed

10 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

3)	A son with a special nature: Independent, headstrong, self-willed, violently aggressive &amp; at odds with others

11 And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.

c.	Worshipping &amp; praising God: El Roi, “the God who sees me”DS3

12 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
13 And she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?

d.	Obeying God
1)	Hagar obeyed &amp; returned

14 Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.

2)	Abram obeyed: Named the son Ishmael, as God had instructed

            <Text>Exegetical Notes to Book 6, Act 2, Scene 1
Setting: Barren Sarah Has a Maidservant, Hagar (16:1)
1. Sarai … had borne him no children. The narrator foreshadowed the problems of Sarah’s barrenness in his introduction to the account in 11:30. The problem has now reached a crisis. The complication of seed resembles the complication of land in 12:10. This dilemma will not be resolved until 21:2, near the end of the act.
Abram’s wife. This designation of Sarah emphasizes her rightful standing. The promised son should come from her.
Egyptian. Hagar was possibly among the maidservants Abraham acquired under Pharaoh’s patronage (12:16).
maidservant. A maidservant is a personal servant owned by a rich woman, not a slave girl answerable to the master. Hagar’s relationship to Sarah resembles Eliezer’s to Abraham (see 15:2); she is answerable to Sarah. The angel of the Lord will reassert this identification (16:8).
Incident 1: Sarah and Hagar (16:2–6)
Unbelief: Sarah’s Scheme and Abraham’s Consent (16:2)
2. The Lord has kept me … perhaps I. Sarah was about sixty-five years old when Abraham left his father and homeland. Still childless a decade later, and perhaps already in menopause, Sarah draws the conclusion that the offspring the Lord has promised Abraham will not come from her body. She recognizes the Lord as Creator of life; however, she does not interpret her infertility in terms of God’s promise. Her complaint condemns her for seizing the initiative from his hands. Without a word from God to authorize her scheme, she is guilty of synergism. Her plan to deal with the problem compares with Abraham’s in 12:11–13 (cf. also Eve’s synergism 4:1).

Go, sleep. The text literally reads “go into,” a Hebraism for coitus.
I can build a family. Literally “I can be built,” this phrase is a Hebraism for “obtain a son” (see 30:3).

through her. The practice of surrogate motherhood for an infertile wife through her maidservant seemed to be an acceptable social practice, as can be judged from Gen. 30:3–12, the Code of Hammurabi (ca. 1700 b.c.), a Nuzi text (ca. 1500 b.c.), an Old Assyrian marriage contract (nineteenth century b.c.), and a Neo-Assyrian text. According to the Old Assyrian marriage contract, after the chief wife procured an infant for her husband, she could sell the surrogate mother whenever she pleased. According to the Code of Hammurabi, however, she could not sell her (see “whatever you think” below).

agreed to what Sarai said. The Hebrew here occurs only in Gen. 3:17. Like Adam, Abraham agrees to his wife’s faithless suggestion. Abraham’s careless passivity sharply contrasts with his valiant actions on behalf of Lot (Gen. 14; 19).
Sarah and Hagar: Conflict in the Home (16:3–4)
3. ten years. See 12:4; 16:16.
Sarai … took [lqḥ] … gave [ntn] … to her husband. This is the same progression of verbs at the Fall in 3:6. Hagar is treated as property with no personal rights.
his wife. The repetition of this designation (16:1) punctuates the foolishness of Sarah’s scheme.
4. despise [qll]. The Hebrew here is translated “curses” in 12:3. Already the plan has deconstructed. This attitude is also a crucial mistake for Hagar. She arrogantly turns on the one who has requested her help. Laws of Ur-Nammu 22–23 and the Law of Hammurabi protected the first wife against this natural response. Because Hagar treats Sarah with disdain, she is alienated from the family of blessing, as is Lot (See Prov. 30:21–23).
Sarah and Abraham: Sarah Complains to Abraham and Drives Out Hagar (16:5–6)
5. You are responsible. Like Eve, Sarah now shifts the blame, and like Adam, Abraham shrugs off responsibility. Abraham alone has the judicial authority to effect a change and up to now has not acted to protect their marriage.

wrong [ḥāmās]. The Hebrew suggests a “flagrant violation of law” (see 6:11).

I am suffering. Although the niv is a paraphrase of the Hebrew expression meaning “the wrong against me,” it captures the right sense. Sarah takes her complaint to Abraham as to a judge to right the injustice. Agur’s proverb affirms her implied meaning: “Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up: … a maidservant [šip̱ḥâ] who displaces her mistress [geḇirtāh]” (Prov. 30:21–23).

despises. In this incident the narrator’s sympathy lies with Sarah; in the next, with Hagar. This is evident because in 16:4 he confirms Sarah’s evaluation of the situation by using the same vocabulary as Sarah. Sternberg says, “The reader infers from the equivalence in language an equivalence in vision where the character’s involvement might otherwise cast doubt on her objectivity.”

may the Lord judge between you and me. Sarah appeals to a still higher court (see 31:53; Ex. 5:21; 1 Sam. 24:12, 15) and confesses her faith in God. If Abraham will not offer the legal protection to which she is entitled, Sarah hopes confidently that the Lord will.

6. whatever you think. According to the Code of Hammurabi, the despised mistress in this situation could not sell her maidservant, but she could mark her with the slave mark and count her among the slaves. The Law of Ur-Nammu prescribed that an insolent concubine have “her mouth scoured with one quart of salt.”

mistreated [ʿānâ]. This is the same Hebrew verb as in 15:13 for the Egyptian mistreatment of the Israelites (cf. Ex. 1:12). Sarah’s reaction is too severe. Victimized by barrenness and Hagar, Sarah now becomes the victimizer. Neither Sarah nor Hagar acquit themselves well here: the mistress is harsh and overbearing; the maidservant is unrepentant and insubordinate.

fled. Like Israel, Hagar flees her mistreatment (Ex. 14:5). The narrator’s sympathies now are on the side of the oppressed maidservant. Nevertheless, Hagar’s deliverance does not lie in returning to Egypt, her native land, but in submitting to the mother of Israel and not despising her.
Incident 2: Hagar’s Encounter with the Angel of the Lord (16:7–14)
Setting: Angel Finds Hagar in the Wilderness (16:7)
7. angel of the Lord. Like all angels, he is a heavenly being sent from the heavenly court to earth as God’s personal agent. In the ancient Near East the royal messenger was treated as a surrogate of the king (Judg. 11:13; 2 Sam. 3:12–13; 1 Kings 20:2–4). So also the Lord’s messenger is treated as God and yet as distinct from God, as God’s angel (cf. Gen. 21:17; 22:11; 31:11; Ex. 3:2; 14:19; 23:20; 32:34). For instance, Manoah and his wife, like Hagar, think the man they have seen is God (13:21–22; cf. 6:22–23; cf. Ex. 33:20). This angel’s name is beyond knowing (Judg. 13:18), and he is associated with worship (13:15). Some equate him with the second person of the Trinity, yet the New Testament never makes this identification. If we may equate him with the angelos kyriou of the New Testament, he announces the birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1:11) and of Jesus (Matt. 1:20, 24; Luke 2:9) and identifies himself as Gabriel (Luke 1:19).
found Hagar. Divine intervention is purposeful and deliberate, not a fortuitous accident (cf. Gen. 12:17).
spring. This sign of life in the desert is a symbol of hope, despite suffering.
Shur. The name means “wall,” probably a reference to the Egyptian border forts along the line of the Isthmus of Suez in order to protect Egypt from the incursion of Asiatics (see 25:18; 1 Sam. 15:7). Hagar was fleeing toward her home in Egypt.
Angel’s Speech and Hagar’s Response (16:8–14)
Initial Exchange (16:8–9)
8. Hagar. This is the only known instance in ancient Near Eastern literature where the deity addresses a woman by name. The greeting makes a trustful response possible.
servant of Sarai. The same Hebrew word is translated “maidservant” in 16:2. This designation of Hagar by the angel confirms Hagar’s appointed place.
where. This rhetorical question elicits her participation (see 3:9).
my mistress. Hagar offers an honest and humble response.
9. Go back. The child she carries belongs to Abraham.
submit. This is the same root as “afflict” (ʿānâ). The woman who wanted esteem and freedom must submit herself. A servant advances not by discarding social boundaries but by honoring them (Prov. 17:2; 27:18).
Angel’s Announcement (16:10–12)
10. The angel added. This is the first of several birth announcements by this heavenly messenger (cf. 17:19; Judg. 13:3, 5, 7; Luke 1:11–20, 26–38). The announcements predict the birth and destiny of those who play a significant role in salvation history.
increase your descendants. God’s command to Hagar to submit is graciously accompanied by a promise. The promise is reaffirmed in Gen. 17:20 and fulfilled in 25:13–16. Abraham will father many descendants (13:16), both elect and nonelect. The nonelect will also be protected by God and made into a great nation (17:20).
11. heard of your misery [ʿonyeḵ]. The Hebrew word translated “misery” is a nominal form of the same root as “mistreated” (16:6) and “submit” (16:9). God’s commitment to Abraham does not void his commitments to the nonelect who also have a future within God’s plans. The Lord looks after the oppressed (29:32; Ex. 3:7; 4:31; Deut. 26:7; 1 Sam. 1:11), redeems human error, and protects the wronged.
Ishmael. The name, which means “God hears,” is explained more fully by “The Lord has heard of your misery.”

Ishmael. The name, which means “God hears,” is explained more fully by “The Lord has heard of your misery.” Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 255). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

12. wild donkey. The fearless and fleet-footed Syrian onager is a metaphor for an individualistic lifestyle untrammeled by social convention (Job 24:5–8; 39:5–8; Jer. 2:24; Hos. 8:9). Ishmael is not a child in whose seed the nations will be blessed; his blessing will be away from the land of promise, living by his own resources.

hostility. His passion for freedom will lead him into conflict with everyone. The fierce aggression of the Ishmaelites is contrasted with the nomadic lifestyle of the patriarchs.

all his brothers. By the end of the Abrahamic narrative, Ishmael and Isaac live in separation (Gen. 25:18).
Hagar’s Worship and Etiology (16:13–14)
13. She gave this name to the Lord. This is the only instance in the Bible where a human being is represented as conferring a name on God. Hagar gives God a name that expresses his special significance to her. She responds to the person, not to the promise. She no longer gloats that she is pregnant but marvels at the Lord’s care for her.
You are the God who sees me. This sentence name is “You are El-Roi” (lit., “God of my seeing”). The name is a pun, meaning either “the God who sees me” (so niv), which fits the context, and/or “the God I see,” which fits her explanation. The former speaks of his care for her; the latter, of her experiences of God’s manifestation.
I have now seen the One who sees me. The Hebrew is difficult and literally reads, “Have I also/even here looked at the back of/after123 my seeing one?” Her question, which demands an emphatic affirmative, probably entails both that she has looked at God and he has seen her.
14. well [beʾēr]. This is a watering place of underground water, but in 16:7 it is called “a spring” (ʿayin). Perhaps a well had been dug close to the spring for convenience.
Lahai Roi. The Hebrew means “belonging to the living one, my seeing one,” thus referring to the same pun (cf. Gen. 24:62; 25:11).
still there. Today the site is uncertain.
Kadesh. See note on 14:7.
In Abraham’s Tents (16:15–16)
15. So Hagar bore Abram a son. Contrast this with 16:1, which notes that Sarah has borne Abraham no children. The cost of Sarah’s human engineering is to watch Hagar give birth to and raise a child for Abraham. The tension for the promised son is only heightened.

Ishmael. The genealogy is given in 25:12–18. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 251–256). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

            <Text>Introduction: this passage covers the birth of the Arabs, the very beginning of the Arabs as a people, their roots and origin. But more importantly, the passage gives us a great study on impatience. It teaches us a great deal about the emotion of restlessness or impatience that grips so many of us so often. What is impatience? It is the emotion …
•	that gets tired of waiting
•	that gets fed up with something that delays us
•	that arouses us to act or react before we should
Waiting and delay are the key words: we just get tired of waiting, of being delayed, and want to move on and act or react. And too often we do, and we cause all kinds of problems for ourselves and for others, often painful and catastrophic problems.
This was what happened to Abram and Sara. They became impatient in waiting for the promised seed, the son promised by God. Their impatience was so gripping that they just felt they could wait no longer. If they did, it would be too late to bear a son. They began to rationalize, to question and say what we often say about the promises of God:
⇒	Could God be waiting for us to do something before He acts?
⇒	Doesn’t God help those who help themselves?
⇒	If we do this, then won’t God do that?
⇒	Doesn’t God expect us to do our part, then He does His?
This kind of reasoning often leads us to act before we should, and the consequences are often terrible and painful. Impatience can cause us to fail in our behavior, plans, and programs, all because we just do not wait upon God, upon His timing, His will, His way. As stated, this was what happened to Abram and Sara. And this is the message of this interesting and instructive passage: Abram Gave Birth to Ishmael and the Arabs: Impatient Faith—the Terrible Wrong of Impatience, 16:1–16.
1.	The causes of impatience (vv. 1–2).
2.	The terrible consequences of impatience (vv. 3–6).
3.	The solution or answer to impatience (vv. 7–16). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 71–72). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Impatience: first, the causes of impatience. Sara illustrates several of the major factors that cause us to be so impatient.
a. An unfulfilled desire. Sara wanted a child desperately. In that day, a woman’s ability to bear children, especially a son, was almost a necessity to remain married. In the eyes of people, children were a sign of God’s blessing, whereas being childless was a sign of dishonor and reproach (Ge. 21:6; 24:60; Ex. 23:26; see Ge. 30:1, 23; 33:5; Ps. 127:3; 128:3). Sara was now seventy-five years old, and she had never borne a child. She felt the shame and remorse, the dishonor that women of that day felt from being childless. Throughout her life, she had been eager to bear a son for Abram, but her desire had never been fulfilled. Sara was childless, and now in her old age she was desperate and becoming more and more impatient. In fact, her patience was running out, and impatience was gaining control of her heart. We will see this in just a moment.
Thought 1. The point is this: an unfulfilled desire can cause impatience; it can cause us to act before we should, to ignore God’s will and God’s timing. Impatience can arouse us to move long before we should …
•	to devise plans and programs
•	to plot and scheme
•	to act and react
Impatience can cause us to try to fill the desire ourselves instead of waiting upon God. This is exactly what happened to Sara, and it is what often happens to us.
b. A mistaken thought. Why was Sara barren, unable to bear children? Was it because God had closed her womb? Closed it permanently, forever? Sara thought so. She began to question God’s promise, to question if the promise made to Abram included her. She felt that she had been left out of the promise given by God, as though the promise did not cover her situation, as though it had no effect upon her life.

Note what Sara did: she told Abram that it was the Lord who had kept her from bearing a child (v. 2). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 72). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. A mistaken thought often leads to impatience and wrong action. We face some problem or crisis, and wonder why God has not helped us or given us the answer. We may even question if the promises of God apply to us, if the promises are even true for us today. Such thoughts are mistaken thoughts: God promises to help us in every crisis and problem of life, even to the most minute problem. God even knows when a single hair falls to the ground, and this is supposedly the smallest care that man has. But note: no problem is too small for God’s concern. God is concerned about us and will help us through all the trials and temptations of life. We must not, therefore, question God’s promises. We must not become impatient and act on our own, running ahead of God. God knows when to act, exactly when to help us. He knows when to fulfill His promises in our lives. We must, therefore, trust God and wait upon His help, His guidance, and His direction. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 72–73). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Now note several facts about this idea of Sara’s.
⇒	Sara’s motive was commendable. She desperately wanted Abram to bear the promised seed. But her method was wrong: it was a worldly, carnal method devised and practiced by unbelievers.
⇒	Sara was making a painful sacrifice for her husband: sharing her husband’s love and body with another woman in order to give him a son. But her sacrifice was stirred by worldly, carnal practices. Consequently, her sacrifice was for nothing. In fact, her sacrifice did nothing but cause more pain and suffering.
⇒	Sara’s idea was to follow a practice of the world, not the Word of God, not the promise of God. Her idea was to follow a worldly, carnal plan, a plan that was practiced by those who lived for the world and the flesh, not for God. Thus her suggestion was a worldly, carnal suggestion.
Note that Abram listened to Sara and did what she suggested (v. 2c). She convinced him that this could be the very way God intended him to bear the promised seed.
Thought 1. A worldly, carnal suggestion can lead us to be impatient:
⇒	to go ahead and act before we should.
⇒	to adopt some worldly, carnal method devised by unbelievers instead of waiting upon God.
⇒	to ignore God’s lead and follow customs and practices of the world. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 73). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Thought 1. The point is this: impatience results in a terrible consequence: a collapsed faith and patience. We cease to trust God, to wait patiently, and what happens?
⇒	Impatience leads us to take matters into our own hands and do our own thing.
⇒	We give in to the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life.
⇒	We end up saying and doing things that are completely contrary to God’s will and Word. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 74). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Impatience leads to sinful behavior (vv. 4–6). This is always true. Note the sinful behavior pointed out by Scripture, the sinful behavior that resulted from the impatience of Sara and Abram.
1)	There were the sins of immorality, adultery, and polygamy: Abram took Hagar as his second wife and she conceived his child (v. 4).
2)	There were the sins of malice, spite, insolence, reproach, scorn, and a haughty spirit: Hagar despised Sara (v. 4). She had been misused for Sara’s own end, and Hagar despised her for it. But there was probably something else as well: when Hagar discovered that she was pregnant, she probably looked upon Sara with scorn and reproach because Sara was childless. Hagar must have walked around with a haughty and insulting spirit toward Sara.
3)	There were the sins of jealousy and of blaming others: Sara was now jealous of Hagar and Abram’s relationship, and note: she blamed Abram for the affair (v. 5). Apparently, she felt that Abram was favoring Hagar for he had not stepped in to correct Hagar’s scorn of her. Abram had obviously chosen to favor Hagar because she was bearing the son for whom he had yearned so long. Thus Sara reacted by appealing to God for help: she called for God to help her, to judge between her and Abram (v. 5).
4)	There was the sin of disturbed relationships, the relationships between Sara and Hagar and between Sara and Abram. Both have already been discussed (vv. 4–5). Now, the relationship between Abram and Hagar was to be disturbed (v. 6). He gave in to his wife’s anger, allowing her to mistreat Hagar.
Thought 1. These were the sins of Sara and Abram’s impatience. Our impatience may not lead into these particular sins, but impatience will always result in sinful behavior, sins such as …
•	disrespectful behavior
•	mistreating people
•	devising worldly plans and programs
•	turning to the world
•	ignoring and running ahead of God
•	selfishness
•	stealing
•	lying
•	deception
•	pride
•	anger
•	bitterness Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 74–75). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

When we act impatiently, we usually mistreat some other person, perhaps several people. This was true with Sara and Abram: their impatience had mistreated Hagar and hurt her deeply, so deeply that she had fled from them and headed home to Egypt. There was danger in this, for she …
•	was turning away from the household of believers and fleeing to a household of unbelievers
•	was fleeing from the hope of the promised land back into the world
•	was fleeing from God’s will for her life and taking her life into her own hands
Note that God knew exactly where Hagar (the mistreated) was (vv. 7–9). He knew that she had been mistreated and had fled from Sara. God knew that she was hurting, that her heart was broken and full of pain. Why then would God’s messenger (“angel” means messenger) ask Hagar where she had come from and where she was going? To arouse conviction within her heart. She needed to sense her wrong in the affair before she would do God’s will: return to Abram and Sara and to the household of faith.
Thought 1. God always knows where we are when we have been mistreated. He knows when we are hurt and full of pain. When we are, we need to hear God’s Word:
⇒	search our own hearts to see what wrong we have done
⇒	repent of that wrong
⇒	get up and do exactly what God says to do Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 75). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

The point is this: God heard the cry of Hagar out in the desert and met her need. She had been mistreated and abused by Sara and Abram. But now God comforted and assured her that both she and her child would survive the ravages of the desert if she would only obey Him. He comforted and assured her by giving her the above promises. All Hagar had to do was to receive the promises of God and obey Him. She had to follow His instructions to the fullest.

Note: the founder of the great religion Islam, Mohammed, is from the land of Ishmael Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 76). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

c. The third answer to impatience is worshipping and praising God (v. 13). Immediately upon receiving the promises of God, Hagar began to worship and praise God. Note: she called God El Roi, “the God who sees me.” God had seen her distress, seen her in her hour of need. God had seen her broken heart and pain. Thus, she worshipped Him as El Roi, the God who had seen her and met her need. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 76). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

d. The fourth answer to impatience is obeying God (v. 15). Note that all three of the guilty parties now repented of their impatience and obeyed God.
1)	Hagar (the mistreated) returned to the household of faith, to the home of Abram and Sara. Hagar fulfilled her purpose …
•	to live as a believer in the household of faith
•	to live in the hope of the promised land while living within the world
•	to bear the child, Ishmael, which God had promised
2)	Abram and Sara both obeyed God. They received Hagar back when she returned, just as God had instructed. And they agreed to name the child Ishmael, just as God had instructed.
Although it is not recorded, at some point Abram and Sara repented of their sin of impatience and of the terrible wrong they had done to Hagar. We know this because they accepted Hagar back and obeyed God in naming Hagar’s son as God had instructed.
Thought 1. The lesson for us is this: If we have been impatient and run ahead of God—if we have devised human plans and substituted worldly methods for God’s will, acting, reacting, mistreating, and hurting others—we must do two things:
(1)	We must go before God to confront Him and repent of the wrong we have done. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 76). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

            <Title>Hamilton</Title>
            <Text>1  The preceding chapter of Genesis had several references to God’s promise to Abram that he would have both a descendant (v. 4) and descendants (vv. 5, 13, 18). The problem with that possibility ever becoming reality is Sarai’s inability to conceive (see 11:30). In some ways the issue is the same as that in 12:10ff. What good are the promises of God if Sarai is dead (12:10ff.), or if her womb is dead? How is the problem of nonfunctioning reproductive organs to be overcome? For at least ten years (16:3) Abram and Sarai have been childless. The brief mention of the presence of an Egyptian maidservant, Hagar (for which see 12:16), opens a window to the following narrative. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17 (p. 443). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

2 Sarai’s words reflect an OT perspective that Yahweh is the ultimate source behind all of life’s experiences, from the exhilarating to the annoying and depressing. And in most cases moral analysis is not required.
To mitigate the problem Sarai suggests that her husband cohabit with Hagar, a suggestion which Abram took to heart. Note, however, that Sarai never addresses or talks of Hagar by name, but only by label or role, my maidservant (see also v. 5; even Abram avoids her name, v. 6). Other ancient texts have provided parallels to what the modern reader of Scripture might consider blatant immorality:
1.	Hammurapi’s Code, § 146: “When a seignior [i.e., a free man] married a hierodule [priestess] and she gave a female slave to her husband and she has then borne children, if later that female slave has claimed equality with her mistress because she bore children, her mistress may not sell her; she may mark her with the slave-mark and count her among the slaves.”
2.	A Nuzi text: “If Gilimninu (the bride) will not bear children, Gilimninu shall take a woman of N/Lullu land (whence the choicest slaves were obtained) as a wife for Shennima (the bridegroom).”
3.	An Old Assyrian marriage contract: “Laqipum took (in marriage) Ḫatala, the daughter of Enišrû. In the country Laqipum shall not take (in marriage) another (woman), (but) in the city (of Ashshur) he may take (in marriage) a priestess. If within two years she has not procured offspring for him, only she may buy a maid-servant and even later on, after she procures somehow an infant for him, she may sell her wherever she pleases.”
4.	A Neo-Assyrian text: (41) “If Ṣubetu does not conceive (and) (42) does not give birth, she may take a maidservant (and) (43) as a substitute in her position she may place (her). (44) She [Ṣubetu] will (thereby) bring sons into being (and) the sons will be her [Ṣubetu’s] sons. (45) If she loves (the maidservant) she may keep (her). (46) If she hates her she may sell her.”
The first three of these texts date to the 2nd millennium b.c., and the last from the 1st millennium b.c. All four demonstrate a marriage practice spread over two millennia in which an infertile wife procures a surrogate wife, a maidservant. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17 (pp. 444–445). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

3  Just as Abram gave Sarai to Pharaoh, now Sarai gives Hagar to Abram. Abram the donor becomes Abram the receiver, and Sarai the pawn becomes Sarai the initiator. Hagar has no choice in the matter. She is “taken,” then “given,” that is, she is essentially an instrument. This all transpires after the couple have lived in Canaan for a decade.
The account provides another illustration of how a child of God, with his or her back to the wall, feels pressed to take the initiative in order to bring God’s promises to pass. Sarai must through some means, any means, have progeny. This story also reflects the replacing of marriage’s primary purpose of companionship (Gen. 2:18) by that of reproduction, with all the resulting negative effects. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17 (p. 446). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

4–5  Hagar, ironically, has no problem at all in becoming pregnant. She is taken or brought to Abram. He has intercourse with her, with no emotional reactions described beforehand or after. But she turns against the very one who solicited her help and becomes pompous toward her (at least Sarai perceives it that way). In actuality Hagar is taking pride in her pregnancy. I would not doubt that Hagar’s judgment about Sarai in v. 4b is the same as is found in the law stated above from the Code of Hammurapi, “if later that female slave has claimed equality with her mistress.” This is quite different, however, from saying something like, “if later that female slave shows contempt toward her mistress,” or some other insulting expression. Sarai is now a non-child-producing ʾiššá, and Hagar is a child-producing ʾiššá. And that is what annoys Sarai and not any barbs that Hagar is throwing at her. Sarai is understandably irked at the conflict this new situation has introduced into her household. Her original intention in making the proposition to Abram was that Hagar would conceive. She did not anticipate the tension that would ensue Hamilton, V. P. (1990). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17 (pp. 446–447). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

6 If Hagar shows some pride, and if Sarai shows a false blame, Abram demonstrates a false neutrality. He too, like Sarai, does not refer to Hagar by name but only by label. For Abram, Hagar is either your maidservant or her. If v. 5 casts Abram in the role of defendant, v. 6a casts Abram in the role of judge. And if Abram will not offer her legal protection, then Yahweh will (may Yahweh decide between you and me). Abram’s judgment on the matter is, at best, lame and passive.

Sarai’s abuse of Hagar (ʿāná III), which forces Hagar to flee (bāraḥ), finds a parallel in the exodus of Israel from Egypt. There, the Egyptians’ oppression of the Hebrews (ʿāná, Gen. 15:13; Exod. 1:11, 12) moved the latter, by God’s power, to flee (bāraḥ, Exod. 14:5). But in Gen. 16 the roles of oppressor and oppressed are just the opposite from Exodus. Here it is a matriarch of Israel oppressing an Egyptian.

The whole event and its unusual character are reflected in the OT’s wisdom literature: “Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot bear up: … and a maid [šip̄ḥá] when she succeeds her mistress [geḇirtāh]” (Prov. 30:21–23). These are the two terms used in Gen. 16 to describe the relationship of Sarai and Hagar to each other. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17 (pp. 447–448). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

12  The announcement by the angel proceeds to delineate the destiny of Hagar’s child. Ishmael is to be a wild ass of the steppe land. This designation is derogatory and derisive. Here we have the metaphorical use of animals, a frequent device in the OT. The wild ass is the onager, whose habitat is in waste places (Job 39:5–8; Isa. 32:14; Jer. 14:6; Hos. 8:9), suggesting a desert, nomadic life-style for Ishmael and his descendants. Jer. 2:24 compares Israel’s zealous pursuit after baals to a wild ass in heat. Once she has picked up the scent of the male’s urine, she becomes frantic for the male; nothing stops her in her lustful pursuit of the male.

Hagar is also told that her child will be involved with belligerent forces and neighbors. This is the thrust of the idiom his hand against every man and every man’s hand against him. Ishmael will both give and receive some crushing blows. For this reason the first part of the last line of the announcement—weʿal-penê—should not be translated “before,” or “east of,” or “in the vicinity of,” but as “in defiance of, against” (for parallels see Exod. 20:3 [perhaps!]; Deut. 21:16; Isa. 65:3).

Because Hagar’s words in v. 13 address the fact that she has seen God, rather than the announcement she has just heard, some have moved to isolate vv. 11–12 from the original story and see the announcement as a secondary, literary tradition. However, the presence of this part of the narrative is necessary to do justice to v. 9. The explicit revelation to Hagar that she is bearing a child with a manifest destiny means that even her return to Sarai (v. 9) cannot be for nought. Hagar need not fear that Sarai will abuse her to the extent that she might lose the child she is carrying. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17 (pp. 454–455).

            <Title>Barrenness Facts</Title>
            <Text>BARREN, BARRENNESS Term used to describe a woman who is unable to give birth to children: Sarai (Gen. 11:30), Rebekah (Gen. 25:21), Rachel (Gen. 29:31), Manoah’s wife (Judg. 13:2), Hannah (1 Sam. 1:5), and Elizabeth (Luke 1:7, 36). Also described as “solitary” (Job 3:7), “desolate” (2 Sam. 13:20; Isa. 49:21; 54:1), or “dead, deadness” (Rom. 4:19). 

Barrenness was considered a curse from God (Gen. 16:2; 20:18; 1 Sam. 1:5), which explains Elizabeth’s statement that God had taken away her “disgrace among the people”—that she was a sinner and cursed by God as evidenced by her barrenness (Luke 1:25). 

The barrenness of Sarai, Rebekah, and Rachel (the mothers of the Israelite nation) is significant in that their ability finally to bear children is a sign of the grace and favor of God toward His elect people. Brand, C., Draper, C., England, A., Bond, S., Clendenen, E. R., &amp; Butler, T. C. (Eds.). (2003). Barren, Barrenness. In Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary (p. 173). Nashville, TN: Holman Bible Publishers.

BARRENNESS. To be a wife without bearing children has always been regarded in the East, not only as a matter of regret, but as a reproach which could lead to divorce. This is the cause of Sarah’s despairing laughter (Gn. 18:12), Hannah’s silent prayer (1 Sa. 1:10ff.), Rachel’s passionate alternative of children or death (Gn. 30:1) and Elizabeth’s cry that God had taken away her reproach (Lk. 1:25). The awfulness of the coming judgment on Jerusalem is emphasized by the incredible statement, ‘Blessed are the barren …’ (Lk. 23:29). It was believed that the gift of children or the withholding of them indicated God’s blessing or curse (Ex. 23:26; Dt. 7:14), as also did the barrenness or fruitfulness of the land (Ps. 107:33–34). Meiklejohn, J. W. (1996). Barrenness. In D. R. W. Wood, I. H. Marshall, A. R. Millard, J. I. Packer, &amp; D. J. Wiseman (Eds.), New Bible dictionary (3rd ed., p. 123). Leicester, England; Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press.

In Israel and among oriental peoples generally barrenness was a woman’s and a family’s greatest misfortune. The highest sanctions of religion and patriotism blessed the fruitful woman, because children were necessary for the perpetuation of the tribe and its religion. It is significant that the mothers of the Heb race, Sarah, Rebekah and Rachel, were by nature sterile, and therefore God’s special intervention shows His particular favor to Israel. Fruitfulness was God’s special blessing to His people (Ex 23:26; Dt 7:14; Ps 113:9). A complete family is an emblem of beauty (Cant 4:2; 6:6). Metaphorically, Israel, in her days of adversity, when her children were exiled, was barren, but in her restoration she shall rejoice in many children (Isa 54:1; Gal 4:27). The utter despair and terror of the destruction of Jerus could go no farther than that the barren should be called blessed (Lk 23:29).

            <Title>Sarah's Plan</Title>
            <Text>“Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said to Abram, ‘Behold now, the Lord has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.’ And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai” (Genesis 16:1-2). Instead of faithfully waiting for God to provide her with a child, Sarah declares that Abraham should cohabit with her servant Hagar in order to produce children for her. Sarah’s desire to procure children in this manner reflects an ancient marriage practice in which an infertile wife would use a surrogate wife, usually a maidservant, to produce a family. Instead of trusting God to fulfill His promise to Abraham through her, Sarah believes that God does not want her to have a child and takes matters into her own hands. She decides to follow a worldly practice (polygamous union) rather than the word of God. Abraham offered no resistance to her idea. Just like Adam in the garden, he ‘listened’ to the voice of his wife but does not consider the future consequences of this decision. As a result of his passivity, life will become more complicated for Abraham. </Text>

            <Title>Unforeseen Consequences</Title>
            <Text>“So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife. And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress” (Genesis 16:3-4). Having successfully implemented her plan to obtain children by Hagar, things begin to go downhill for Sarah. Whereas  she previously thought she would escape the stigma and shame of barrenness, Hagar becomes arrogant and allows her pride of conception to show contempt towards Sarah.  So we see that in addition to the sins of adultery and polygamy, Sarah and Abraham’s decision lead to the sin of disrespectful behavior on Hagar’s part. Family strife continues to intensify as Sarah directs her anger towards Abraham - “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the Lord judge between you and me!” (Genesis 16:5). Though she initiated the plan, Sarah now blames Abraham for the current state of affairs! It’s entirely possible that Abraham, who has been waiting decades for a child, paid more attention to Hagar at this point. Maybe Sarah felt that he favored Hagar over herself for Abraham had not intervened to address Hagar’s attitude towards Sarah. In fact, Abraham appears to be lame and passive through the entire episode. The man who once conquered armies on the battlefield now appears weak on the home front. In response to Sarah’s complaint, he tells her to deal with the situation as she desired. Perhaps he felt the truth of the proverb that says the earth trembles and cannot bear up the situation in which a maidservant displaces her mistress (Proverbs 30:21-23)! </Text>

            <Title>The God Who Sees</Title>
            <Text>Impatience with God’s timing led to Sarah’s plan to build her family through Hagar. Hagar became pregnant with Abraham’s child and their family life began to deteriorate. Sarah’s low self-esteemed plummeted as Hagar scorned her barrenness. And with Abraham’s permission, Sarah went to war against Hagar with bitter rage. The text reads “Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her” (Genesis 16:6b). What followed for Hagar is an unexpected encounter with God through which we learn several lessons.
God is aware of Hagar’s plight. He knows that she is being mistreated and has been placed in the middle of a difficult situation. It’s possible that she was given to Abraham and Sarah during their time in Egypt. As a servant, she has very little (if any) control over her life circumstances. She has fled from Sarah out into the wilderness, headed back to Egypt as a pregnant woman without anything. However, the Lord does not allow her to perish in the wilderness. Instead, he sent His messenger to comfort her and to make her aware of her contribution to the conflict. He commands Hagar to return to Abraham’s household and submit to Sarah. As a result of her encounter with the divine, Hagar is to repent of her sin by treating Sarah with respect. As Christians, we must remember that God knows when we have been mistreated. He does not turn a blind eye to the family struggles and relational conflicts we experience. However, God calls us to examine how we sinfully contribute to tensions in our homes, jobs and congregations. Through His word, He commands us to repent and to seek peace in all our relationships - “If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all” (Romans 12:18).
Despite the sin and mistakes committed by God’s chosen couple, God will greatly multiply the descendants of Abraham through Ishmael (Genesis 16:10). Ishmael, which means “God hears”, will be the father of the non-elect line of Abraham’s descendants who will be strongly independent and who will live in conflict with everyone (Genesis 16:12). Hagar now knows that God has plans for her son and future descendants. She knows that God was looking after her through the conflict with Sarah and that He will protect her when she returns to her mistress. Through this dysfunctional situation, she became the first woman to whom the angel of the Lord appears and to whom God gives a promise. God used Hagar’s lonely moment of desperation in the desert to give her strength and hope for the future. Consequently, she commemorates her encounter with the angel by naming the location Beer-lahai-roi (“belonging to the living one, my seeing one”) and returns to give birth to Ishmael (Genesis 16:15-16).

            <Text>Genesis 17:1–27
1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless, 
2 that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly.” 
3 Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him, 
4 “Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. 
5 No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. 
6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings shall come from you. 
7 And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you. 
8 And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.” 


9 And God said to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations. 
10 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 
11 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. 
12 He who is eight days old among you shall be circumcised. Every male throughout your generations, whether born in your house or bought with your money from any foreigner who is not of your offspring, 
13 both he who is born in your house and he who is bought with your money, shall surely be circumcised. So shall my covenant be in your flesh an everlasting covenant. 
14 Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.” 


15 And God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. 
16 I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.” 
17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said to himself, “Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?” 
18 And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live before you!” 
19 God said, “No, but Sarah your wife shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his offspring after him. 
20 As for Ishmael, I have heard you; behold, I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation. 
21 But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this time next year.” 


22 When he had finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham. 
23 Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all those born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins that very day, as God had said to him. 
24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
26 That very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised. 
27 And all the men of his house, those born in the house and those bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

            <Text>J.	Abram Had the Covenant Reconfirmed by God: Aroused Faith—the Steps to a Fresh, Stirring Experience with God, 17:1–27
(17:1–27) Introduction: Abram was desperate. He had been wanting a son ever since his marriage to Sara, and they most likely had been married for over fifty years. Thus Abram’s longing—his hopes and dreams—to have a son had been gnawing at him for over fifty years. But Sara had been unable to bear children. In desperation, when Abram was an old man, Sara had suggested that Abram take her maid, Hagar, and try to bear a son through her before it was too late. This Abram did, and Ishmael was born. Abram’s dreams for a son were finally realized in Ishmael. Did Abram ever expect to have another son, a son other than Ishmael? Not likely, for he was now ninety-nine years old, and Sara was eighty-nine, both well beyond childbearing years. Abram was well aware of this fact; verse 17 tells us this. 
Apparently Abram had felt that Ishmael was the son promised by God, that God was going to fulfill His promises through Ishmael. Abram loved Ishmael dearly. Note verse 18, where Abram cried out for God to remember and bless Ishmael. Ishmael was thirteen years old, and because of Abram’s life-long desire for a son, he no doubt loved Ishmael more deeply than the average father. The bond between them was probably closer than the bond between most fathers and sons. 
Apparently Abram had become comfortable and settled in life, somewhat complacent and lethargic, slumbering and slacking off. Abram just accepted reality: he was too old to bear any more children, and Ishmael was the only child he had. Thus he felt Ishmael was bound to be the son promised by God.

But as this passage so clearly reveals, this was not God’s plan. Ishmael was not the promised seed, not the son promised to Abram. Thus Abram’s faith needed to be aroused once again. Abram needed God to arouse—stir, quicken, awaken—his faith to look beyond Ishmael …
•	beyond the present
•	beyond the physical
•	beyond the possible

Abram needed to be renewed, to look at the impossible and to believe in the miraculous power and works of God. Note how this is exactly what we need. When a believer becomes comfortable—at ease, complacent, and lethargic—in life, he needs to be aroused by God. He needs a fresh, stirring experience with God similar to Abram’s experience. 

This is the subject of this important passage: Abram Had the Covenant (Promises) Reconfirmed by God: Aroused Faith—the Steps to a Fresh, Stirring Experience with God, 17:1–27.
1.	Step 1: receiving a fresh revelation from God: God is the Almighty God (v. 1).
2.	Step 2: making a new commitment to walk before God and to live a blameless, perfect life (vv. 1–2).
3.	Step 3: humbling oneself before God and listening to God (vv. 3–5).
4.	Step 4: hearing and believing God’s covenant or promises (vv. 6–8).
5.	Step 5: keeping the covenant and sharing in the ritual of the covenant: keeping its meaning always in one’s mind (vv. 9–14).
6.	Step 6: changing the relationship to one’s family (vv. 15–18).
7.	Step 7: accepting the will and purpose of God (vv. 19–21).
8.	Step 8: making a public decision and obeying God’s instructions, His Word (vv. 22–27).

Abram was ninety-nine years old and Sara eighty-nine. It was physically impossible for them to conceive a child. Thus what Abram needed was to see God as El Shaddai, the Almighty God, the God who possessed all might and power, the God who could do anything. Almighty God could quicken the bodies of Abram and Sara and make them fertile and cause a son to be born to them. Abram needed to believe this promise; he needed to believe the impossible. Therefore, God revealed Himself as the Almighty God, the God of all power, the God who could fulfill His promise and who could meet the needs of Abram and his dear wife. (See Deeper Study # 1, Almighty God—Ge. 17:1 for more discussion.)
Thought 1. God is the Almighty God; He possesses all might and all power. He can do all things; in fact, there is nothing that God cannot do.
Thus when we face difficult, impossible circumstances, we should seek God, seek the power and promises of God. We should seek a fresh revelation from God, to see God as the Almighty God, as the God who can do all things.
 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 79–80). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Walk, Spiritual—Believer, Life: How can we arouse our faith, have a fresh, stirring experience with God? Step two is to make a new commitment to walk before God and to live a perfect or blameless life. The believer’s life is not a static, complacent life. When God gives us a fresh revelation—some new insight or knowledge—He expects us to act, to put the new knowledge to use, and to grow thereby. This was true of Abram. God gave Abram a fresh revelation of Himself as the Almighty God, but God also told Abram to recommit his life and to do so more diligently than ever before. God charged Abram to make two commitments:
a. He was to walk before God: this means to live step by step in the presence of God; to live moment by moment in fellowship with God; to live in an unbroken consciousness of God; to be always aware of God’s presence, power, and security. Three pictures are painted by this descriptive phrase.
⇒	To walk before God means that we live before Him in a spirit of devotion, worship, fellowship and service.
⇒	To walk before God means that we do not walk behind Him nor ahead of Him. But we walk before Him, conscious that He can see us and that He has the power to look after and care for us.
⇒	To walk before God means that we are aware of His power to see and know all, aware that He will judge us for all we do

 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 80–81). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


He was to be perfect or blameless (tamim). This means just what the Hebrew word says: to be sound, complete, without any lack or failure whatsoever; it means to be blameless, without blemish. Scripture is not teaching sinless perfection, for no person has or ever will live a sinless and perfect life, no person other than Jesus Christ our Lord. But Scripture is teaching holiness, that Abram and all other believers are to walk before God diligently seeking to live perfect, blameless lives. We are …
•	to live holy lives before Him
•	to develop a heart that is single-minded, set upon God first and foremost throughout all of life
•	to live lives that are wholly devoted to the Lord
•	to be conformed to the image of Christ
•	to please God with all our hearts
Thought 1. We live in days of immorality, lawlessness, and violence; and tragically we make excuse after excuse for our loose living. We do our own thing, live like we want, and try to excuse our sinful behavior by blaming society, environment, circumstances, or the weakness of human nature. But note the words of Arthur W. Pink as he explains the kind of life we are to live before God: Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 81). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

How can we arouse our faith, have a fresh, stirring experience with God? Step three is to humble ourselves before God and to listen to God, to His Word, to what He has to say to us. No doubt, Abram immediately fell on his face at the first appearance of God. The brightness of God’s glory would strike any person to the ground. The point is this: Abram humbled himself before God; he got as low as he could to show reverence for God, that he was ready to listen and to receive whatever message God had for him. 

God said two things to Abram:

a. God reminded Abram that it was he who had been chosen to receive the covenant of the promised seed. He and he alone, not someone else, had been chosen to be the father of many nations.
Thought 1. The stress is upon God’s call, the appointment of Abram to be God’s servant. When God calls us—any of us—to serve Him, we must humble ourselves before Him and listen to His call.

b. God changed Abram’s name to Abraham (v. 5). The meaning of Abram is high father; the meaning of Abraham is the father of a multitude. This experience with God was to be a turning point in Abram’s life: the promised seed was soon to be born through Sarai. Thus God gave Abram a new name to remind him of this experience with God: God’s great call and covenant, of God’s great assurance to fulfill His promise.

Thought 1. God has given the believer the very name of His own dear Son, Christian (Acts 11:26; 26:28; 1 Pe. 4:16). The great need of the hour is for believers to humble themselves before God and remember the great name He has given them, the name of Christian. The name should remind us …
•	of our conversion experience
•	of other deep experiences with God
•	of God’s great call to us, the great task He has given each of us to do
•	of God’s promises (covenant) of His assurance to fulfill the promises made to us

 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 82). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


There was the promise of the promised seed (vv. 6–7). Abraham was to be very fruitful. His descendants were to include nations of people, and some were to be very prominent, holding the highest office possible, that of king. Remember, Abraham was the father of …
•	the Arabs through Ishmael
•	the Jews through Isaac
•	the nations born of a third wife, Keturah (see Ge. 25:1–4)
•	the believers of the world: Scripture says that we are the spiritual children of Abraham (Ga. 3:7–9; see Ro. 4:11–12)
Now, note what else God says: the promised seed is an everlasting covenant established by Him (v. 7). What does this mean? It means that Abraham will have descendants upon earth as long as the earth stands.

But note another fact as well: God established the promised seed as an everlasting covenant for a reason: that He might be the God of the promised seed, be their God forever. God wants a personal relationship with Abraham’s descendants; He wants a people with whom He can fellowship and pour out His mercy and grace, a people who will worship, serve, and live for Him eternally.

This is very significant, for it tells us exactly with whom God established the everlasting covenant. The everlasting covenant applies to Abraham and all those who follow in the steps of Abraham. Who are they? Believers. All persons who walk upon earth believing God just as Abraham believed God; all persons who follow after God just like Abraham did. The point is this:
⇒	God gave Abraham the promise of the promised seed, of many nations and descendants.

⇒	But God also gave Abraham a very special promise: that He would establish the covenant of the promised seed forever. There would always be those who would do just what Abraham did: believe God and follow diligently after God. And God would be the God of these descendants forever. Note that this is the promise of eternal life—an everlasting covenant—to those who truly follow after God as Abraham did. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 82–83). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


b. There was the promise of the promised land (Canaan) (v. 8). Note that God also established the promised land as an everlasting covenant. Abraham and his descendants are to possess the land forever. But again, the everlasting, eternal reference must apply to the eternal land of Canaan, to heaven itself. Heaven is the only world that is eternal, that will last forever. The promised land is given to all Jews and Gentiles who believe and follow after God just as Abraham did. God is the God of those who believe in Him and follow Him. True, He wants to be the God of unbelievers, but unbelievers do not believe in Him. They will not let Him be their God. Consequently, God is not the God of unbelievers: the promised land is not theirs eternally. Unbelievers may possess it now, during this world, but they will not possess it eternally, in the perfect world that is coming. (See outline and notes—Ge. 12:1c for more discussion.) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 83). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

God gave Abraham the sign or ritual of the covenant: circumcision. The outline of the Scripture is self-explanatory:
1)	Circumcision was to include all male children (v. 10).
2)	Circumcision was a sign of the covenant and only a sign (v. 11). It was a sign that a person was dedicating and committing his life to believe the promises (covenant) of God and to follow after God with his whole heart.
3)	Circumcision was to be performed at a set time: when the child was eight days old (v. 12).
4)	Circumcision was to include every household: every male, free or enslaved (vv. 12b–13).
5)	Circumcision was to be an everlasting sign (v. 13b). What does this mean? How could a physical, earthly, temporal sign be an everlasting sign? It can’t. Even common sense tells us this. Nothing on this earth lasts forever. God is referring to the meaning lying behind the sign or ritual, referring to the covenant itself. The sign was to remind believers of God’s great covenant established with Abraham …
•	that the promised seed was assured; the Savior would come to the earth, and there would always be a nation of believers who followed after God just as Abraham did, a nation of genuine believers who would live forever.
•	that the promised land was assured; the true children of Abraham would inherit the land, an eternal land forever and ever.
6)	Circumcision was to be strictly observed: refusal to share in the ritual was to be severely punished. A man who refused to be circumcised was to be cut off from the people. This meant that the person was to be removed from those who believed the covenant and followed after God, cut off from those who walked after the faith of Abraham.
Thought 1. What does the ritual of circumcision say to believers today?
(1)	Jesus Christ has performed a spiritual circumcision upon believers. He has circumcised the believer, cut away the whole sinful nature of the believer. He cuts away more than just a piece of flesh; He performs radical surgery: He cuts away the whole body of sin, all the sin which the believer has committed and for which he stands guilty Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 83–84). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Circumcision—God’s true circumcision—is of the heart, not of the flesh. God never intended circumcision to be only a ritual, a physical sign that one belonged to the people of God. Yes, circumcision was to be a sign, but a sign of spiritual truth: a sign that a person’s heart belonged to God, totally and wholly, a sign that one was following and living for God, fully and completely. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 84). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Warren Wiersbe says this about the believer’s spiritual circumcision:
What does all of this [circumcision] mean to Christian believers today?… We have experienced a “spiritual circumcision” (Col. 2:9–12) that makes us part of the “true circumcision” (Ph. 3:1–3). When we trusted Christ to save us, the Spirit of God performed “spiritual surgery” that enables us to have victory over the desires of the old nature and the old life. Circumcision removes only a part of the body, but the true “spiritual circumcision” puts off “the body of the sins of the flesh” (Col. 2:11) and deals radically with the sin nature.
This “spiritual circumcision” is accomplished at conversion when the sinner believes in Christ and is baptized by the Spirit into the body of Christ (1 Co. 12:13). This baptism identifies the believer with Christ in His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension, and also in His circumcision (Col. 2:11–12; Luke 2:21). It is not “the circumcision of Moses” but “the circumcision of Christ” that is important to the Christian believer. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 84). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


Thought 2. Old Testament circumcision and New Testament baptism can be compared as follows:

Circumcision: the cutting away of the flesh meant that one was …

Baptism: being immersed in water meant that one was …

1.	Renouncing the flesh, all human effort in approaching God.

1.	Dying to self and the past (Ro. 6:3; Lu. 9:23).

2.	Willing to believe God and to obey God, to be identified as a follower of God no matter the pain or cost.

2.	Being raised to newness of life, willing to live a new life for Christ no matter the cost (Ro. 6:4).

3.	Becoming identified with the people of God.

3.	Becoming identified with the followers of Christ, the church (1 Co. 12:13).


Thought 3. Romans 4:11 says that God gave circumcision to Abraham for two reasons: to be a sign of Abraham’s faith and to be the seal of Abraham’s righteousness. Note the verse: Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 84). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Sara—Family: How can we arouse our faith, have a fresh, stirring experience with God? Step six is to change our relationship to our family.
a. Note that God honored Sara, greatly honored her. Did Abraham harbor feelings against Sara, secretly blaming her for not being able to bear children? Did he treat her like he should, in love and respect? Was his relationship with her as strong as it should have been? We know that he mistreated her on two occasions, once before this encounter with God and once after (Ge. 12:11–16; 20:2–18). Whatever the case, God honored Sara, and He instructed Abraham to so honor her.
1)	God gave Sara a new name, “Sarah,” and He told Abraham to call Sara by that name. “Sarah” means princess. Abraham was hereafter to look upon Sarah as a princess, and he was to call and treat her like a princess. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 85). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Thought 1. Every husband should treat his wife with respect and love, especially if she is a true believer and follower of God. The Christian wife has the promises of God at her disposal. She can claim God’s promises and bring great blessing upon the family. Thus, she should be treated as the princess of the family and household.
Thought 2. If the Christian husband wants an aroused faith, a fresh, stirring experience with God, he may need to change his relationship with his wife. He may need to change his behavior toward her, begin to treat her with a renewed love and respect, treat her as the princess of the home. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 86). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Note that Abraham worshipped in astonishment and prayer (vv. 17–18). He fell to his face again, utterly astonished, laughing with joy and rejoicing flooding his heart. A believer who has been broken, truly broken, while God is flooding him with assurance knows what Abraham was experiencing. He was astonished, just amazed that such a thing could be. Note that he thought to himself, wondered at what he had heard:
“How can Sarah and I have a child? I am one hundred and Sarah is ninety years old. Such is just too wonderful to be true. But it is true, for God has promised it.”
But then, within just a few moments, Abraham thought of his son Ishmael, the only son he had ever known, the son who was then thirteen years old and whom he had grown to love, the son whom he had thought was to be the promised seed. It dawned upon Abraham that his relationship with Ishmael was being changed, that Ishmael was not the promised seed. He had been wrong about Ishmael: all his hopes and dreams had been wrapped up in the boy, misplaced and out of line with God’s will. Immediately, Abraham cried out for God to also bless Ishmael, that God would not forget the son whom he loved so much, that God might let Ishmael live under His very special blessing (v. 18).
Thought 1. Every father should love his children as Abraham loved Ishmael, and he should cry out for God to bless his children, to bless them in a very special way. In fact, a father must love and pray for his children before God will ever arouse his faith, before God will ever give him a fresh, stirring experience with Himself Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 86). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

He drove His will into Abraham’s heart:
⇒	Sarah was to bear a son, the promised seed (v. 19).
⇒	the son was to be named Isaac (note that God Himself named the son, v. 19).
⇒	the covenant established with Isaac was to be an everlasting covenant (v. 19).
⇒	Ishmael was to be blessed, especially blessed, in answer to Abraham’s prayer: Ishmael was to become a great nation of twelve rulers (v. 20).
Note that God reconfirmed His will a third time in verse 21: the covenant of the promised seed and promised land was to be established with Isaac, not with Ishmael nor with anyone else. The promised Savior was to come through Isaac and his descendants, the Jews. As Scripture clearly says, “Salvation is of the Jews” (Jn. 4:22). Note also that God set the time for Isaac’s birth: he was to be born about one year later (v. 21).
Thought 1. We must follow the example of Abraham: accept and surrender to the will and purpose of God. Whatever God calls us to do, we must do it. We must surrender to His will for our lives. This is the only way we can ever have an aroused faith. God cannot give us a fresh, stirring experience with Himself unless we surrender to His will. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 86–87). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Decision—Obedience: How can we arouse our faith, have a fresh, stirring experience with God? Step eight is to make a public decision and obey God’s instructions, His Word. Note: as soon as God had finished speaking with Abraham, Abraham got up and acted: he took his whole household and did exactly what God said to do. He obeyed God’s instructions, God’s Word. His decision was made public, for God’s instructions were to involve the whole household.
a. Abraham led his whole household to obey God, to enter into the covenant relationship: all the men and boys were circumcised (v. 22).
b. He took the lead, setting the example in the covenant relationship at an old age: he was circumcised at age ninety-nine (v. 23).
c. He led his own child to obey God, to enter into the covenant relationship—at the early age of thirteen (v. 25).
d. The account is reemphasized: to stress the importance of the covenant relationship (v. 27).
Thought 1. Every adult should make a public decision and obey God’s instructions, His Word. And every adult should lead his or her household to obey God, to enter into the covenant relationship with God: to accept the promised Savior and the promised land of heaven. If we want God to arouse our faith, to give us a fresh, stirring experience with Himself, we must obey His Word. We must publicly act on His Word, witness and bear testimony to our household.

1. ninety-nine. See above, “Literary Analysis: Blank, Janus, and Inclusio.” Ishmael, age twelve or thirteen, is entering manhood (cf. 16:16). God must make clear to Abraham that Ishmael is not the blessing carrier.

I am God Almighty [ʾēl šadday]. El Shaddai, God’s principal name in the pre-Mosaic period (cf. Ex. 6:2–3), may signify his universal dominion. Shaddai is attested primarily in Genesis and Job, as a theophoric element in three personal names of tribal representatives at the time of the Exodus (Num. 1–2), and in an Egyptian servant’s name, probably Semitic, of the late fourteenth century b.c. Because of its antiquity, its meaning was lost by the time of the translators. The lxx, among many other ways, rendered it by “your God.” Jerome based his translations (deus omnipotens) “God Almighty” and its equivalents on another rendering in the lxx, kyrios pantokratōr (Job 15:25). The Targum often transliterated the term. Like the ancient translators, modern scholarship has reached no consensus on the basis of philology. The most probable suppositions are (1) “The Powerful, Strong One” from the root šdd; and (2) “The One Who Suffices” from še and day. Whatever its exact meaning, the contextual uses suggest, as Wenham states, that “Shaddai evokes the idea that God is able to make the barren fertile and to fulfill his promises.”126

walk before me and be blameless. See 6:9. Total obedience is the necessary condition to experience the covenant promises. To walk before God means to orient one’s entire life to his presence, promises, and demands. Westermann states, “God orders Abraham (now representing Israel) to live his life before God in such a way that every single step is made with reference to God and every day experiences him close at hand.” This significant command is later repeated to Israelite kings (Solomon, 1 Kings 9:4–5; Hezekiah, 2 Kings 20:3). Such a high standard is appropriate for Abraham, who will become the father of kings (cf. Gen. 24:40; 48:15).

blameless. The Hebrew word signifies wholeness of relationship and integrity rather than no sin (see 6:9).

2. I will confirm. This is better translated “that I might give.” Although Abraham is responsible to walk in companionship with God and to abstain from sin, the covenant is still entirely a gift from God.

my covenant. The three divisions of this covenant—“As for me …” (17:4–8), “As for you …” (17:9–14), and “As for Sarai …” (17:15–16)—recognize the obligations of all the partners. God promises commitment to Abraham and his offspring (17:4–8, 15–16); they follow his commands (17:9–14). This unequal partnership always depends on the divine presence and provisions.

3. Abram fell facedown. This is a typical act of worship (Lev. 9:24; Josh. 5:14; Ezek. 1:28).

4. As for me. This formula marks the first division of the covenant obligations: God’s responsibilities.

5. Abram … Abraham. See 11:26. His former name spoke of his noble God, of his noble ancestry, or of his own eminence; his new name speaks of his many offspring. This is the name God will make great (12:2). Abram, composed of ʾāb (“father”) and rām (“to be high”), means “Exalted Father,” a reference either to God, Terah, or himself. His new name Abraham, by a word play of ʾāb (“father”) plus hām (hāmôn, “crowd”), sounds like “father of a multitude.” Although this etymology is disputed, this is how the text explains his name: “[because I will make you] the father of many nations [ʾāḇ-hamôn]” (17:4 and 5).
have made you. The Hebrew is better translated, “I will make you.”

father of many nations. See 15:5; 28:3. In “Theme of Genesis and Biblical Theology” (see introduction), I argue that God’s promise to make Abraham a father of many nations should be understood in both a biological sense and in a spiritual sense. 

The biological interpretation is validated by the genealogies of Keturah (25:1–4), Ishmael (Book 7, Gen. 25:12–18), and Edom (Book 9, Gen. 36). 

The interpretation that he fathers the nations that reproduce his faith finds support both within the immediate text and within the canon. In contrast to the promise that kings will come out of his loins, it is not said the nations he fathers are thus begotten. Moreover, circumcision, the sign of the covenant, is extended to every male in Abraham’s household, “whether born in your household or bought with your money” (17:12–13; see also Theological Reflections below). 

The psalmist (Ps. 87:4–6) and the apostle Paul (Rom. 4:16–17; cf. Gal. 3:15–19) both interpret the text with reference to the Gentiles becoming Abraham’s offspring. According to this spiritual interpretation, “father” designates a spiritual relationship; it is so used to describe the relationship of Joseph to Pharaoh (Gen. 45:8) and a Levite to Micah (Judg. 17:10).

kings. In primary view are Israel’s kings (see 35:11; 49:10; 2 Sam. 7:8–16) but also the messianic king (see Theological Reflections below).

7. everlasting covenant. See 12:3; 15:5. God’s covenant endures forever because he is faithful and does not change (see Theological Reflections below).
between me and you and your descendants. This legal formulation guarantees that at the death of the owner the land will be passed on to the next generation in perpetuity.
to be your God. This is the heart of the covenant, guaranteeing that God will protect his people and provide them with life and prosperity (cf. 17:8; Jer. 24:7; 31:33; Ezek. 34:30–31; Hos. 2:1; Zech. 8:8).

8. land … everlasting possession. See 13:15. Later “this gift of an unending covenant” (God, seed, land) will become “a critical affirmation for Israel in the time of the exile in Babylon,” enabling them to hope for the future.

Canaan. See 12:1, 7; 13:15; and 15:18 regarding the Promised Land.



Law of Circumcision Set Forth (17:9–14)
9. As for you. This marks the second division of the covenant obligations: Abraham’s responsibilities.
keep my covenant. Wenham explains, “Whereas inaugurating the covenant was entirely the result of divine initiative, confirming it involves a human response, summed up in v 1 by ‘walk in my presence and be blameless’ and spelled out in the demand to circumcise every male.”
10. circumcised. This ritual marks something as set apart. Here the organ of procreation is consecrated to God (cf. Deut. 30:6; Jer. 4:4). Roop argues that circumcision is also a sign of solidarity. The circumcised become members of the community with whom God has an unending relationship (see Theological Reflections below).
12. eight days old. Some cultures circumcise their children at puberty as a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood in the community. God employed the sign for infants to show that the children, coming under the authority of the parent who confesses faith, are “holy” (i.e., they are separated from the profane world and belong to the covenant community; see Rom. 11:16; 1 Cor. 7:14). Fox argues that circumcision in infancy is a “daring re-interpretation, at once defusing the act of exclusively sexual content while at the same time suggesting that the covenant is a lifelong commitment. The males of the tribe are not simply made holy for marriage. They bear the mark upon their bodies as a sacred reminder of their mission.” By the eighth day the baby has completed the cycle of time corresponding to the course of creation (cf. Ex. 22:30; Lev. 22:27).
born … bought … not your offspring. The covenant promises are extended to all the circumcised, who are reckoned as members of the faithful family (cf. 14:14).
13. covenant in your flesh … everlasting. The finite physical mark symbolizes a spiritual reality as indicated by Abraham’s spiritual fatherhood and the promise of an everlasting covenant. The Hebrew ʿôlām, translated “everlasting,” means “the most distant time,” a relative concept according to a text’s horizon (cf. Ex. 12:14; 27:21; Lev. 3:17; Num. 10:8; Deut. 15:17). As long as God administered his nation by their physical lineage from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the sign of physical circumcision endured.
14. will be cut off. God will sever the disloyal descendant from the covenant community and from its benefits of blessing and life. The disloyal is doomed to extinction and is liable to premature death.
he has broken. This expresses the opposite of keeping God’s covenant (17:9).
Sarah the Progenitrix of Numerous Nations and of Kings; Her Name Is Changed (17:15–22)
15. As for Sarai. This marks the third division of the covenant obligations: the responsibilities of Sarah and Abraham’s seed.
Sarai … Sarah. Sarah’s importance to salvation history is borne out by the fact that she is the only woman in the Bible whose name is changed and whose age at death is detailed (23:1). The exact meaning of her name change is unclear. Though the lxx associates the new name Sarah with a Hebrew word meaning “strife,” both Sarai and Sarah are probably dialectical variants meaning “princess.” The promise that she will bear kings supports this interpretation. Sarai, her birth-name, probably looks back on her noble descent, whereas Sarah, her covenantal name, looks ahead to her noble descendants (see “father of many nations,” 17:5).
16. bless her … give you a son. See 1:22; 12:2.
nations … kings … from her. Primarily her spiritual motherhood is in view (see “father of many nations,” 17:5).
17. fell facedown. Is his humble posture (see 17:3) a cover-up for his inner skepticism?
laughed. Abraham again stumbles in incredulity after the covenant has been given (cf. 12:10–20). Isaac means “he laughs.” The name is punned upon in 18:12–15; 21:6.
18. If only Ishmael. As Roop describes, “Abraham reacts … not with joy and celebration, but with consternation: it is a complication in his life.”
19. you will call him Isaac. Isaac’s name means “he laughs.” It is as if God, responding to Abraham’s doubtful laughter, says, “You laugh, but I will bring about my promises with joy.” Both Abraham and Sarah first laugh in disbelief (see 18:12), but at Isaac’s birth Sarah will laugh with joy at the supernatural work of grace (21:1–7; Rom. 4:19–21).
20. as for Ishmael … twelve rulers … great nation. God pastorally reassures Abraham that Ishmael will not be excluded from a blessing. Indeed he too will father a great nation, with twelve tribes corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel (cf. 25:12–16).
21. with Isaac. Isaac represents the living God’s triumph over barrenness. By his own sovereign counsel the Lord elects Isaac, not Ishmael. The Lord’s chosen race will not come by natural generation but by supernatural grace at the ordained time (see Rom. 9:6–13).
Law of Circumcision Carried Out (17:23–27)
23. On that very day. This expression marks a significant moment (see also 7:13): the scene’s climax when Abraham shows himself a faithful covenant partner by immediately fulfilling his obligations.
26. Ishmael. Both the elect and nonelect children receive the sign of the covenant. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 258–263). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

            <Title>I Am God Almighty</Title>
            <Text>“When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, ‘I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless, that I may make my covenant between me and you, and may multiply you greatly’” (Genesis 17:1-2). The Lord appeared to Abram when he most needed reassurance and encouragement to remain faithful. The Lord reveals Himself as ‘God Almighty’ (El Shaddai), the omnipotent One who possesses all power to fulfill His promises and who can make Abram and Sarah fertile in their old age. Abram needed to believe that the Lord could achieve the impossible in their lives. He needed to understand that it would be by the power and grace of God that they would conceive a child. God uses difficult and humanly impossible circumstances to move us to greater levels of trust in Him. He uses our weaknesses as occasions to display His power. Our attitude needs to be the same as the apostle Paul who wrote “therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me” (2 Corinthians 12:9b).
However, the experience of God’s grace and power does not release us from the necessity of obedient faith. If Abram wanted to inherit the covenant promises, he would have to make God the number one focus of his life. Every step he took would have to be made asking “Is this God’s will for me?” He would have walk before the Lord fully aware of His power to fulfill His promises. In addition, the Lord called him to be ‘blameless’, just as “Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation” (Genesis 6:9). This does not mean God would only fulfill His promise if Abram lived sinlessly for the rest of his life. It means that Abram is to live as Noah, who was wholly devoted to God and did not conform to the immorality of his generation. God expects the same of His faithful people today.  God calls us to live holy lives before Him, to develop hearts that are totally devoted to Him, to be busy about putting to death our old sinful habits and to be conformed to the image of Christ.
Abram’s response to the Lord is reverential worship - “Then Abram fell on his face” (Genesis 17:3). He recognizes that the Lord is the all-powerful King of the universe and that he is the servant. Such reverence can be learned as we hear and read God’s words. The more we saturate our hearts and minds with God’s great promises given to us in Scripture, the more we are impressed with the mercies of God. Our proper response to God’s power and mercy is to humble ourselves to offer ourselves to God as holy and acceptable living sacrifices (Romans 12:1-2).  
The Lord reminds Abram of and expands upon His covenant responsibilities. Whereas God previously promised to make of Abram a great nation, now He promises that Abram will “be the father of a multitude of nations”  and changes his name to ‘Abraham’ to relect his new identity (Genesis 17:4). These nations will include those that come from Isaac, Ishmael (Genesis 25:12-18), Keturah (25:1-4), and Esau (Edom).  Furthermore, Abraham will be the spiritual father of an untold number of nations that reproduce his faith - all Christians are the spiritual children of Abraham (Romans 4:16-17). In addition, the covenant between God and Abraham is an everlasting covenant because God Himself is faithful and does not change. Abraham will die before the final fulfillment of the promise, but God guarantees its fulfillment through Abraham’s offspring.

            <Title>Preaching Christ</Title>
            <Text>Verse 1, “When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him, ‘I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be blameless.’ ” The Lord introduces himself as the great King, ʾĒl Šadday, “God Almighty.” The etymology of ʾĒl Šadday is “obscure, but wherever it is used in Genesis, it is associated with divine omnipotence, his ability to fulfill his promises and especially to make the barren fertile (28:3; 35:11; 48:3).” The great King desires to make a covenant, a sacred treaty, with Abram. 

But before God Almighty specifies the covenant promises, he succinctly states the conditions Abram must meet: “Walk before me, and be blameless.” Abram is to be like Noah, of whom we read, “Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God” (Gen 6:9). 

With Noah God had also made a covenant. The sign of that covenant was the rainbow. Now God is ready to make with Abram a special covenant with the sign of circumcision. 

Like Noah, Abram has to walk with God—literally, he has to walk “before God” (v. 1). “This phrase [‘before God’] usually expresses the service or devotion of a faithful servant to his king.” It means to live in such a way “that every single step is made with reference to God and every day experiences him close at hand.”15 

And like Noah, Abram is to be blameless. The Hebrew word translated “blameless” does not mean “sinless” but “whole”: “It signifies complete, unqualified surrender.” Abram is to be wholly devoted to God, his King. Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 168–169). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

God continues speaking to Abram, verse 2, “And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will make you exceedingly numerous.” Nine times in this narrative, God speaks of my covenant. It is God’s covenant; he initiates this sacred treaty. And God promises to make Abram “exceedingly numerous.”
In response to God’s words, Abram falls “on his face,” that is, he prostrates himself before God the way servants bow down before their king. He acknowledges the “master-servant footing of the covenant.”

Then, while Abram is lying face down like a servant before his King, God says to him, verse 4, “As for me, this is my covenant with you: You shall be the ancestor [father] of a multitude of nations. No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for I have made you the ancestor [father] of a multitude of nations.” The great King gives his servant a new name—a name that gives expression to God’s covenant promise to make Abraham “the father of a multitude of nations.”

“Throughout the Near East the inauguration of a new era or a new state policy would frequently be marked by the assumption of a new name expressive of the change on the part of the king.” Here God Almighty begins a new phase with his servant Abraham. God explains the meaning of the name Abraham: “father of a multitude of nations.” Twenty-four years earlier, God had promised Abram, “I will make of you a great nation” (Gen 12:2). But now God promises that Abraham will be the “father of a multitude of nations.” This is an important turning point for Abraham. The new name is “a divinely guaranteed statement about Abraham’s identity and future destiny. His very name guarantees that he will father many nations.” It confirms God’s initial promise to Abram: “in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed” (Gen 12:3). Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 169–170). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

God Almighty continues to stress this new phase in Abraham’s life in verses 6 and 7, “I will make you exceedingly fruitful; and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you. I will establish my covenant between me and you, and your offspring after you throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.” Two new items stand out. First, this is not a temporary covenant but an “everlasting covenant,” similar to the “everlasting covenant” God made with Noah and every living creature (9:16). This covenant is made with Abraham and his seed after him “throughout their generations.” 

Second, the promise “to be God to you” is the essence, the core, of this covenant. “The essential heart of the covenant is defined: ‘I shall be their God.’ I, El Shaddai the omnipotent creator of the world and redeemer of mankind, will be Israel’s God. This nation descended from Abraham is to be unique, because unlike the other nations, Israel enjoys a unique relationship with the only true God.” 

In verse 8 God repeats the essence of his covenant, “And I will give to you, and to your offspring after you, the land where you are now an alien, all the land of Canaan, for a perpetual holding; and I will be their God.” This is what God will do for Abraham and his seed.

 Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (p. 170). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

Jesus established this new covenant the night before he died. At the Last Supper he told his disciples, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood” (Luke 22:20). The author of Hebrews confirms that Jesus established this new covenant: “For this reason he [Christ] is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, because a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant” (Heb 9:15; cf. Eph 3:6).

But what happened to God’s covenant stipulation that, as a sign of covenant membership, all males be circumcised? Jesus was circumcised (Luke 2:21), but after his resurrection he sent his disciples out not to circumcise but to baptize: “Make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matt 28:19). 

The first Church Council in Jerusalem considered the all-important question whether Gentile believers should still be circumcised in this new age Jesus had inaugurated. This Council decided, “It has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to impose on you no further burden than these essentials: that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what is strangled and from fornication” (Acts 15:28). The painful rite of circumcision is no longer required for covenant membership. 

Jesus shed his precious blood once for all, thus ending the bloody rites and sacrifices of the old covenant. Paul insists to the Galatians (6:15) that “neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is anything; but a new creation is everything!” 

Baptism now becomes the sign of covenant membership. “As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek; there is no longer slave or free; there is no longer male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to the promise” (Gal 3:27–29; cf. Col 2:11–14). 

In this new covenant, not only males but also females receive the sign of baptism. Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 176–177). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

            <Title>The Sign of the Covenant</Title>
            <Text>Now God states Abraham’s covenant responsibility -  “This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised” (Genesis 17:10). Just as the rainbow was the sign of God’s covenant with Noah, circumcision becomes the sign of this covenant. Circumcision, the cutting of the foreskin from the genitalia, was to be performed on male infants the eighth day after their birth and on all older males, even upon slaves and foreigners born outside of Abraham’s household. Thus, God’s covenant with Abraham extended beyond non-elect and non-biological lines. Hamilton notes that the Lord established circumcision as the sign of the covenant to bear witness to Abraham’s faith in God’s promises. It was an amen to the Lord’s word as was his faith in Genesis 15:6 (Hamilton, p. 472). Those who rejected circumcision, thus the condition of being included in the covenant, were to be cut off from God’s people (Genesis 17:14).
As Christians, we participate in the new covenant established by Jesus the night before he died when he told his disciples while instituting the Lord’s Supper, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood” (Luke 22:20). After his resurrection, the Lord sent out his disciples not to circumcise, but to call would-be Christians to faith and baptism: “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned” (Mark 16:15-16). God’s promise to Abraham is open to all to participate in regardless of race, nationality, or gender according to Galatians 3:26-29: “for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise.”

            <Title>Hamilton</Title>
            <Text>We take the position that circumcision is a means by which Abraham and his seed ratify God’s lordship over them. It is their identity sign as God’s covenant people. As such, circumcision is not a cognition sign, one for God’s benefit, but rather a confirmation sign, one bearing witness to Abraham’s belief that God would fulfill his promises with respect to progeny. Accordingly, Abraham’s circumcision is as much an amen to Yahweh as was his affirmation in 15:6. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 1–17 (pp. 471–472). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B.

            <Title>Sarah's Barrenness Will End</Title>
            <Text>Next, the Lord reveals to Abraham Sarai’s role in the covenant: “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name. I will bless her, and moreover, I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall become nations; kings of peoples shall come from her” (Genesis 17:15-17). God honored Sarai and included her in the covenantal promises despite her earlier attempt to do things her way. He gave Sarai a new name and identity, “Sarah”, which in the original Hebrew means “princess”. If Abraham will be the father of many nations, Sarah will be the mother of many nations. God said He will indeed end her barrenness and bless her with a son. In response, Abraham humbly falls to his knees and laughs because he finds God’s statement incredible. He deeply loves his oldest son Ishmael and requests that the Lord’s covenantal promise be upon him. Ishmael will indeed be blessed, but the Almighty God has different plans regarding the elect. By His supernatural grace, God will enable Sarah to conceive a child by Abraham on the Lord’s time table! Decades of barrenness will not prevent God from fulfilling His promises through Sarah. Isaac, which means “he laughs”, will be a living reminder of the power and miraculous blessings of God. </Text>

            <Title>Genesis 18</Title>
            <Text>Please read Genesis 18 and answer the following questions:

What has happened so far in the narrative? Have there been any major events, characters or themes?
God appears to a 99-year old Abram. He reveals Himself as God Almighty and commands him to live blamelessly before Him
God changes Abram’s name to Abraham, for he will be the father of a multitude of nations. God reaffirms his promises and covenant with Abraham and his descendants
God commands Abraham to circumcise all the males in his household, including Abraham himself. Circumcision becomes the sign of the covenant
God also changes Sarai name to Sarah. He reiterates that she will be blessed with a son within the year and that he is to be named Isaac. God will establish His covenant with Isaac.
Abraham laughs at God’s plans for Sarah, who is now advanced in years, and asks God to make Ishmael the covenant heir. However, God rejects Abraham’s request and comforts him with a blessing on Ishmael. God reassures Abraham that He will also bless Ishmael, but that His covenant will continue through Isaac, who will be born in one year. Abraham responds in obedience by circumcising all members of his household.

Summarize the events in Genesis 18
Three visitors, the LORD and two angels, visit Abraham
Abraham provides hospitality to them
The LORD tells Abraham that he and Sarah will bear a son at this time within the next year
Sarah, who is well into menopause, laughs in unbelief and is confronted by the LORD.
The LORD tells Abraham of impending judgment upon Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham bargains with the LORD to spare the cities.

1. Who visited Abraham and Sarah? As the story proceeds, who did the visitors turn out to be?

Three men visited them. The visitors turned out to be the LORD and two angelic beings.
This is actually the Lord and two angels
One man is none other than the Lord, as 18:2–3 and especially 10, 13–15 make explicit.
Textual note in v.3: “O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant…”
 The translation “my lord” is misleading, since the Hebrew text refers to a title for God. niv translates the same Hebrew in 18:27 as “the Lord” (see 18:1, 13, 17), although it should be written in uppercase. Abraham addresses “the Lord” (singular) in 18:3 and all three men (plural) in 18:4–5.

2. What acts of hospitality did Abraham offer to the visitors (vv 2-8)? (Think: What can we learn about eating these various kinds of food?)

He offered to clean their feet, a place to rest, and some bread as he prepared a meal of curds, milk and beef for them.
seahs. A seah is two gallons (eight liters) of a grain.
Abraham’s offering of “something to eat” turns out to be a royal banquet. In the ancient Near East, goat’s milk was especially prized because of its energy and easy digestibility

3. Special Assignment: What do other passages teach us regarding hospitality or kindness to strangers?

Abraham’s receptive hospitality is a model for welcoming God’s presence. Abraham requests that the three visitors remain with him, saying, “Do not pass your servant by” (18:3). So should the church respond when Christ knocks to be invited in for fellowship (see Matt. 25:31–46; John 6:53–58; Rev. 3:20; 19:7).

4. What prediction did the visitors make regarding Sarah?
They predicted she will have a son within a year
I will surely return. This is a clear indication that the speaker is the Lord, since he alone can faithfully promise life out of barrenness and decay.
God makes a promise demanding faith

Special Assignment: What does this and other passages teach us regarding God’s promise and our faith?
God’s promises often fall outside the realm of our reasoning
However nothing exceeds God’s power, not even virgin birth and resurrection
But faith transcends reason. Abraham’s recognition of God’s power is the kind of faith that believes God raised our Lord Jesus from the dead, a faith that justifies (Rom. 4:22–25; cf. Judg. 13:18–25; Luke 1:37–38, 45)


5. How did Sarah react to this prediction and why? What do we learn about Sarah?

Sarah laughed in unbelief because she was very old and the way of women had ceased to be with her
Sarah’s body is procreatively dead (see Rom. 4:19; Heb. 11:11–12).

6. What did God say about Sarah’s reaction, and how did Sarah then respond?

The Lord asked, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’Is anything too hard for the Lord?”
Everything is possible with God (Ge. 15:4-6; Heb. 11:11; cf Jer. 32:17; Mark 10:27; Luke 1:37)
Sarah lied and denied her unbelief saying, “I did not laugh”
Scripture does not gloss over the sins of the faithful
God rebukes Sarai for lying. He can read our thoughts and knows our motives.

7. What did God knew Abraham would do for his household and children (v19)?

God knew that Abraham would command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice
The way of the Lord - metaphor for right behavior that leads to a right destiny due to one relationship with the Lord (p. 268)
Right and just - Abraham’s faith in God leads him to promote the well-being of his household.  A righteous person rightly orders community and a just one restores broken community, especially by punishing the oppressor and delivering the oppressed. (p. 268)
Israel’s inspired spiritual and ethical heritage was passed down through generations within the home (see, e.g., Deut. 6:6; Prov. 1:8). That heritage originated in the revealed will of God through gifted individuals such as Moses and Solomon, who in turn handed their law and wisdom to the parents to teach the next generation. There is no record of a school in Israel before the late intertestamental period; families were the source of all education, including trades
Deuteronomy 6:6
Proverbs 1:8

8. Special Assignment: List and explain two other passages showing the duty of fathers toward their families.

Proverbs 22:6 - Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it. 
Ephesians 6:4 - Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.

9. What did God say He intended to do regarding Sodom and Gomorrah?

God plans to destroy both cities.

10. What request did Abraham originally make regarding Sodom, and what was his final request which God granted? (Think: What reason did Abraham offer for his request? Whom was he primarily concerned about?)

Abraham is concerned that the righteous would be caught in God’s impending judgment, specifically Lot. 
So Abraham bargains with God to spare the cities if 50 righteous people could be found there. The Lord finally agrees to spare Sodom if even 10 righteous people could be found.
Here we see Abraham’s compassion and high concern for justice. He doesn’t want the destiny of the righteous to be determined by the wicked ones in the community.
We also see Abraham’s humility and submission to God “I am nothing by dust and ashes…”

11. Special Assignment: List and explain two passages about the power of prayer.

12. Meaning: what does the narrator say about the events?

The narrator creates an intimate picture of Abraham, the consummate host, rushing to prepare a great feast for his guests.

13. Is there some attitude or behavior you need to change?
We are not locked into lives of barrenness.
Faith acts upon God’s promises and purposes, not my desires and ability.

14. How does the passage point forward to what God is going to do in the future? Does it prophesy or anticipate Jesus Christ in some way?

15. How could you sum up the meaning of this passage in your own words?

Application
• How does this passage challenge your understanding about who God is and what he is like?

            <Text>Exegetical Notes to Book 6, Act 2, Scene 3
Incident One: Announcement of Isaac’s Birth (18:1–15)
Appearance of Divine Visitors (18:1–2)
1. appeared. To “appear” and “see” is a key of this scene (18:1, 2 [2x], 21; see also 19:1, 28).
The Lord appeared. With the Lord’s return appearance (see 17:1), he confirms his revelation of 17:19 and declares certain and swift fulfillment. This appearance also clearly identifies Abraham as a prophet who is given foreknowledge of God’s plans and judgments.

entrance to his tent. Contrast this with 19:1. Abraham sits in the shade of a sojourner’s tent, a welcoming place to travelers; Lot will sit at the gate of an evil city, hazardous to strangers who enter.
heat of the day. Abraham lives by his subjective experience of the day’s downy light, noon-day heat, and cool evening breeze, not by hours and minutes. During the heat of the day travelers seek shade and rest. Abraham does not appear inconvenienced by the interruption of his siesta or by the labor he must do in the day’s heat.
2. three men. This is actually the Lord and two angels (see 18:1, 10; 19:1). The later identifications of the “men” (18:10, 13, 16–17, 33; 19:1) confirm their manifest difference. One man is none other than the Lord, as 18:2–3 and especially 10, 13–15 make explicit. However, the Lord and his heavenly assembly in their incarnation appear in human form (see 16:7).
standing nearby. The narrator describes the oriental equivalent of knocking at the door.
When he saw them, he hurried. Abraham’s rush to welcome his guests is immediate.
bowed low to the ground. Abraham’s address, “my Lord” (see below) and his reference to himself as “your servant” are accompanied with an appropriate gesture of awe and humility (18:3). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 266–267). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

Abraham’s Hospitality (18:3–8)
3. found favor. This is always spoken to one of higher rank.
my lord. This is better translated “my Lord.” The translation “my lord” is misleading, since the Hebrew text refers to a title for God. niv translates the same Hebrew in 18:27 as “the Lord” (see 18:1, 13, 17), although it should be written in upper case. Abraham addresses “the Lord” (singular) in 18:3 and all three men (plural) in 18:4–5.
your servant. The consummate host offers himself humbly.
4–5. wash your feet … rest … eat … refreshed. Abraham attends to all his guests’ unspoken needs.
6–7. hurried … Quick … ran … hurried. The narrator creates an intimate picture of Abraham, the consummate host, rushing to prepare a great feast for his guests. Throughout the story Abraham is completely at their service.
6. seahs. A seah is two gallons (eight liters) of a grain.
fine flour. Given the rapid preparation of Abraham’s meal, it is likely that he also offered bread without yeast, but the narrator blanks this fact to feature Abraham’s bread made of fine flour in contrast with Lot’s bread made without yeast (see 19:3).
7–8. choice, tender calf … curds and milk. Abraham’s offering of “something to eat” turns out to be a royal banquet. In the ancient Near East, goat’s milk was especially prized because of its energy and easy digestibility.
8. While they ate. The narrator slows the story from action to dialogue. The initiative passes to the strangers, specifically to “the Lord” as the prime speaker. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 267). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.


Annunciation of Isaac’s Birth (18:9–15)
9. Where. This is a rhetorical question, since the Lord knew what Sarah was doing behind him (see 18:13–15). The question conveys the Lord’s concern and secures Sarah’s attention for the announcement.
10. I will surely return. This is a clear indication that the speaker is the Lord, since he alone can faithfully promise life out of barrenness and decay.
about this time next year. The promise (15:4) and covenant (17:16–21) is now escalated to a precise time.
Sarah … son. God makes a promise demanding faith (see below, “God’s Promise and Faith” in the Theological Reflections).
11. past the age of childbearing. The Hebrew literally reads, “Sarah no longer experienced the cycle of women.” Her body is procreatively dead (see Rom. 4:19; Heb. 11:11–12; see also “God’s Promise and Faith” below).
12. Sarah laughed. Both Abraham and Sarah first laugh unbelievingly at God’s promises (see 17:17).
my master. See 1 Peter 3:6. Sarah understands her social identity and significance in her relationship to Abraham.
pleasure. This is a unique Hebrew term, of uncertain meaning, translated “conception” by an ancient Aramaic translation, “lust” by HALOT,144 and “delight” by J. D. Price. Abraham and Sarah have accepted barrenness as normal.
13–14. Why did Sarah laugh … is anything too hard. As assurance of his miraculous power, the Lord verbalizes Sarah’s secret thoughts. His rhetorical question declares that, since he is God, everything is possible (see 15:4–6; Heb. 11:11; cf. Jer. 32:17; Mark 10:27; Luke 1:37).
15. lied. The Bible does not gloss over the sins of its hero and heroine of faith (cf. 12:13).
you did laugh. This is both a restorative rebuke (Prov. 28:13) and an assuring sign: the one who reads her thoughts can open her womb. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 267–268). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

Incident Two: Abraham Pleads for Sodom (18:16–33)
Journey Note Overlooking Sodom (Janus Verse for Incidents One and Two) (18:16)
16. they looked down toward Sodom. The strangers effect beginnings and endings as the messengers of hope and life to Abraham and Sarah and of judgment and death to the people of Sodom and Gomorrah (Deut. 32:39; 1 Sam. 2:6; Ps. 76:7; Isa. 45:7).
Divine Reflections on Abraham and Sodom (18:17–21)
17. the Lord said [or “thought”]. The narrator records God’s internal dialogue for the reader, in order to explain the true nature of the discussion that follows. This dialogue between the Lord and Abraham is for Abraham’s benefit, to challenge him to act wisely and nobly for justice. The narrator is a prophet in his own right (see “Moses and Ur-Genesis” in the introduction).
Shall I hide. God so esteems his servants, the prophets, that he “does nothing without revealing his plan” to them (see Gen. 20:7; Jer. 23:16–22; Amos 3:7; John 15:15).
18. a great and powerful nation. See 12:2–3. Such a nation has to learn justice beginning with its father, Abraham (18:17–19). The Lord models justice to Abraham in his treatment of the Sodomites (18:20–33) and through this remarkable dialogue he educes Abraham’s integrity.
19. I have chosen him. The text literally reads, “I have known him” (i.e., “I have an intimate relationship with him”; see 4:1).
direct. The same term, which means “to command, to charge,” is used in connection with the law of Moses. Pedagogy in ancient Israel was strict and urgent.
his children and his household. Israel’s inspired spiritual and ethical heritage was passed down through generations within the home (see, e.g., Deut. 6:6; Prov. 1:8). That heritage originated in the revealed will of God through gifted individuals such as Moses and Solomon, who in turn handed their law and wisdom to the parents to teach the next generation. There is no record of a school in Israel before the late intertestamental period; families were the source of all education, including trades.
the way of the Lord. The phrase is a technical metaphor for right behavior that leads to a right destiny due to one’s relationship with the Lord. Eugene H. Merrill explains, “The way (derek) is … the whole course of life lived in conformity to covenant obligation.”
right and just [ṣedāqâ ûmišpāṭ]. Righteousness portrays a way of living in community that promotes the life of all its members, a life promoting social order in recognition of God’s rule (see 6:9). A righteous person rightly orders community, and a just one restores broken community, especially by punishing the oppressor and delivering the oppressed.
so that. The conditional aspect of the Abrahamic covenant is explicit here (see 17:2; 22:15–18; 26:4–5).
20. outcry [zeʿāqâ]. In 18:21 and 19:13 the term ṣeʿāqâ is used; here its synonym occurs. As the Judge of the earth, the Lord receives all cries of wrongdoing (see 18:25; 4:10). The Hebrew word play with the “right” (ṣedāqâ) actions of Abraham highlights the moral failure of Sodom.
their sin. The narrator spoke earlier of Sodom’s wickedness (13:13; see also ch. 19, esp. vv. 4–5 and note; Ezek. 16:49–50).
21. go down and see. This is the narrator’s figurative way of saying that God always thoroughly investigates the crime before passing sentence (see 3:11–13; 4:9–12; 11:5). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (pp. 268–269). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

Abraham Intercedes for Sodom (18:22–33)
22. The men. This is presumably the two angels/messengers (18:1; 19:1). Appropriately, two go to confirm the crime, as later in Mosaic law two witnesses are needed for capital punishment.
Abraham remained standing before the Lord. Although the scribes attempted to keep the text “correct” (b. Ned. 37b–38a), they sometimes changed it.148 According to their own notes, the original text read, “The Lord remained standing before Abraham.” This expression of God’s condescension was so great it seemed blasphemous to the scribes. If their note on the original is the correct reading, it suggests that the Lord is challenging Abraham to play the role of a righteous judge.
23. Abraham approached him. Abraham the great host is also Abraham the compassionate prophet who intercedes and upholds justice. He stands as a “preserver” in the line of Enoch and Noah. Fox argues, “Without this story Abraham would be a man of faith but not a man of compassion and moral outrage, a model consistent with Moses and the Prophets of Israel.”
Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? Abraham’s arguments for sparing Sodom are founded on a concern for justice, not merely the presence of his nephew Lot in the city. Roop states, “Acting as the one chosen to promote life, Abraham … [proposes] that the future of everyone be determined not by the wicked ones in the midst of the community, but by the righteous ones.” God agrees. God spares the righteous when he judges a nation, as in the cases of Rahab (Josh. 2), Assyria (Jonah 3–4), and Israel (see Ezek. 14:12–20). The situation differs considerably, however, in cases of natural disaster that are not judicial judgments (see Job 9:22; 12:4, 16; Luke 13:4).
24. fifty. This is about half of a small city (Amos 5:3).
25–32. Far be it from you!… I am nothing but dust and ashes.… This is an expression of profound deference and humility. Abraham evidences his leadership qualities in his boldness, moral wisdom, and skillful speeches to God.
25. kill. The language carries overtones of a judicial sentence (Lev. 20:4; Num. 35:19, 21).
Will not the Judge of all the earth do right? The Hebrew literally means “to do justice” (i.e., to restore a community’s right order under God’s rule by punishing those who destroy it with oppression of the weak and by delivering the oppressed). The question could be read as a challenge to God, but sound theology demands it be read as a deliberative prayer asserting faith in God’s just character and as a “conduit for the divine fulfillment.”153
26. If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom. Like the people of Noah’s age, the Sodomites had opportunity to repent and change their wicked ways. As with everyone, their time of grace to repent comes to an end.
I will spare. The Hebrew literally means “lift up.” It is unclear whether this means to “lift up [face],” meaning to show grace, or to “lift up [sin],” meaning to forgive.
32. ten. Ten is still a community; fewer than ten can be saved individually, as happens in Genesis 19.
33. he left. It is now established that the judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah, the paradigm for God’s future judgments, is just. The Lord investigates the accusations thoroughly (18:22), ensures two objective witnesses, involves the faithful in his judgment, displays active compassion for the suffering, and prioritizes divine mercy over indignant wrath (i.e., not to be destroyed if even ten are righteous). The Lord himself will not appear again in this act; in the next scene he will rain down the judgment from heaven (see 19:24). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001).

            <Text>Abraham Was Visited by God Himself (Part 1): Growing Faith—How to Be a Friend of God, 18:1–15.
1.	The Lord appeared and sought Abraham’s friendship (v. 1).
2.	Abraham sat, bowed his head, and meditated (vv. 1–2).
3.	Abraham served and met the needs of people (vv. 2–8).
4.	Abraham was to believe the great promise of God: the promised seed (vv. 9–10).
5.	Abraham and Sarah had to conquer unbelief (vv. 11–15). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 89). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


a. Abraham is called “the friend of God” three times, two times in the Old Testament and one time in the New Testament.
⇒	Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, said this in one of his prayers to God:
“Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever?” (2 Chr. 20:7).
⇒	God Himself said this to Israel:
“But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend” (Is. 41:8).
⇒	James the writer of the New Testament book said this:
“And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God” (Js. 2:23).
b. Jesus Christ Himself deliberately said that His followers were His friends.
“Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you” (Jn. 15:14–15).

2 (18:1–2) Meditation—Prayer: How can we become a friend of God? Meditate and pray Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 89). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. The point is this: meditation and prayer are the way to draw closer to God, the way to become a close, intimate friend with God.
(1)	Meditation draws us closer to God.
“But know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the Lord will hear when I call unto him. Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah” (Ps. 4:3–4). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 90). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

3 (18:2–8) Service—Ministry How can we become a friend of God? Serve and meet the needs of people. Abraham is a strong example in serving others, and remember he was one of the most powerful sheiks in Canaan, if not the most powerful (Ge. 14:1–24).
a. Abraham, sitting there in the doorway of his tent, looked up; and immediately he saw three men standing nearby (v. 2). Who were the three men? The Lord and two angels. Several verses tell us this (v. 1, 10, 13, 14). When did Abraham know that it was the Lord? We cannot tell from the story, but he certainly knew by verse ten when the Lord reconfirmed the promise of the promised seed or son. It is, of course, possible—perhaps probable—that the Lord revealed Himself from the first. We certainly do not have the whole conversation here, and it would seem reasonable to expect the Lord to reveal His identity.
b. Abraham ran to meet the men (v. 2). He did not have to do this: he could have ignored them, just let them pass by, or sent one of his servants out to them. After all, he was resting and praying and thinking through the enormous life-changing plans God had thrust upon him. But Abraham cared about people: he knew the travelers were walking out in the noon day heat and had most likely been traveling all morning. He knew they would be tired, thirsty, hungry, and dirty. He could not fail to offer them help and refreshment.
c. Abraham bowed, was humble and courteous (v. 2). Again, remember his status was that of a powerful sheik, yet he went out to them himself, demonstrating a most courteous, humble posture: he bowed to the ground. Bowing to the ground may indicate that Abraham knew that it was the Lord and angels from the first.
d. Abraham sought to help and spend time with the three men (vv. 3–5). He showed the most gracious hospitality, inviting them to come to his home so that he could minister to their needs. He offered them water to drink and to wash their dusty feet. He also offered them food and the opportunity to rest. Note that they accepted the invitation.
e. Abraham involved his wife in serving (v. 6). He did not act alone. Serving others is both a privilege and a duty. He wanted the person most dear to him by his side, serving right along with him as he ministered. He wanted Sarah to fulfill her duty as the wife and to experience the joy of the occasion herself.
f. Abraham gave the best he had (v. 7). He ran to his herd, selected, and prepared a young calf to serve—a choice, tender calf.
g. Abraham served the men himself: he became personally involved (v. 8). He could have sat down with them and had Sarah or servants serve them all together. But Abraham took the posture of a servant and served the three men himself. He became personally involved in the service and ministry: he sought to personally meet their needs.
h. Abraham demonstrated humility: he stood off to the side just as a servant would. He did not sit down with them. (This would indicate that Abraham knew that he was serving the Lord Himself. Being a powerful sheik, he most likely would have sat and had conversation with other men.)
Thought 1. Abraham is a dynamic example in serving others. He was a humble, ministry-minded person. Remember how he offered Lot the first choice of land (Ge. 13:8–9); how he rescued the people of Canaan, including Lot, from the invading army; how he accepted Hagar back after she had run away with their son, Ishmael (Ge. 16:1–16).
Abraham was always serving and helping others. And he was, no doubt, very busy managing his large holdings. Again, he is a strong example for us in serving others. We should always be looking to help people in need. When we spot people in need, we should run to meet them, be courteous, and seek to help meet their needs. We should follow the very steps that Abraham took in meeting the needs of these three men. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 90).

Deeper Study # 1
(18:2) Theophany: before Christ came, God spoke to men “in many ways” (He. 1:1). As an example, He sometimes appeared:
⇒	in human form (Ge. 3:8; 5:24; 6:9; 18:1–33).
⇒	in some form of majestic glory (Ezk 1:1–28, esp. 26–28; Is. 6:1–13; see note—Ge. 16:7; see Ex. 3:2; Jos. 5:13–15; Jud. 2:1–5).
Such appearances are called theophanies. In simple terms, a theophany is a visible appearance of God to man, usually in a human form. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 91). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.



5 (18:11–15) Unbelief—Lying—God, Power; Knowledge of: How can we become a friend of God? Conquer unbelief. Note three significant things.
a. The causes of unbelief are clearly seen in this experience of Sarah.
1)	Sarah and Abraham were looking at an impossible situation, humanly speaking. They were both beyond childbearing years. Abraham was one hundred years old and Sarah was ninety years old.
2)	Sarah allowed negative thoughts to enter her mind. As stated above, she had heard the Lord’s promise to Abraham, but she knew the impossible circumstances. The whole situation just seemed laughable to Sarah, and she actually laughed to herself, somewhat mockingly and skeptically. She murmured silently to herself, “How can I who am so old have the pleasure of sex and bear a child, and Abraham also being so old—impossible! A laugh!” Sarah was responding to God’s promise in unbelief: she just did not believe God’s promise, did not believe it was possible. It was physically impossible to her. Note that she was thinking of the circumstances, not thinking of God and His promise and power.
b. The answer to unbelief is twofold (vv. 13–14).
1)	God’s omniscience, His knowing all things. God asked Abraham why Sarah had laughed, revealing that He knew all about Sarah’s unbelief.
2)	God’s omnipotence, His power to do all things (v. 14). “Is anything too hard for the Lord” (v. 14). God can do anything, no matter how impossible it seems. He clearly said that He would give Sarah a child despite her dead womb (see Ro. 4:19).
“I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee” (Jb. 42:2).
“But Jesus beheld [them], and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible” (Mt. 19:26).
“For with God nothing shall be impossible” (Lu. 1:37).
c. The conquest of unbelief (v. 15). Sarah lied: she denied that she had laughed, for she feared a severe rebuke from the Lord and perhaps from Abraham. But the Lord made it clear: she did laugh—laughed in unbelief—and He knew all about her failure to believe the promise of the promised seed. Moreover, she was now lying about the matter.
What the Lord was doing was telling Sarah that she needed to confess, repent, stop the deceit and lying, and believe the promise. God could perform the miracle, overcome the circumstances of life, no matter how impossible they might appear. God could fulfill His promise. Sarah could conquer unbelief only if she confessed, repented, and believed the promise of the promised seed.
Thought 1. Unbelief will always keep us from being a friend of God. The friend of God believes God; he never disbelieves. We must, therefore, conquer unbelief:
⇒	We must not look at circumstances as though they are impossible for God.
⇒	We must not allow negative thoughts to surround the promises of God, questioning His promises.
⇒	We must believe that God knows all and can do all.
⇒	We must confess and repent of our sin of unbelief, of distrusting the promises of God.

(18:16–33) Introduction—Prayer—Intercession: God wanted Abraham to do something special, very special. God wanted Abraham to become an intercessor, that is, a believer who struggles and wrestles in prayer for others, and who does it often. The words struggle, wrestle, and often are the key words. God wants believers who will pray often—constantly-believers who will struggle and wrestle in prayer for people and for the needs of the world.
“The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance” (2 Pe. 3:9).
How do we become intercessors? Get alone and focus our thoughts and prayers upon people in need, upon both the unbelievers and believers of the world. When prayer is approached with strong concentration of thought, when the world is completely shut out, prayer often becomes intense. One just becomes deeply conscious of God’s presence and deeply conscious of the needs of others and of the world. The believer begins to struggle for others, for the needs of the world. He draws near God and near those for whom he is praying. He senses that both God and others are ever so near. He loves God and loves those for whom he is praying—loves them ever so intensely. He wrestles with God for them, not because God is hard to reach and unconcerned and must be struggled against, but because he feels so much concern and so much love that he just pours out his heart to God. In the process, the prayer warrior is drawing much closer to God and gaining a much deeper concern for man! He is learning to love God more and to love man more, and this is exactly what God wants. God wants believers to be near Him and near others; to love God and others—to live both for God and for others; to be both God-centered and man-centered.
Just think of the impact upon this world—the enormous impact for good—if enough believers would become intercessors!
Note one other fact as well. God knew exactly what was going to happen to Sodom before this event with Abraham took place. He knew that Lot was the only righteous person in the city. What then was God’s purpose in leading Abraham to intercede in prayer time and time again? God’s purpose was at least threefold:
First, to teach Abraham—and all others who followed him—to become intercessors, prayer warriors, for both the righteous and wicked of the earth.
Second, to teach Abraham—and all others who followed him—that God’s justice must be executed. Every human being will face the judgment of God.
Third, to teach Abraham—and all others who followed him—to become stronger witnesses for Him. Abraham had been a strong witness to Lot and, no doubt, to his family. Abraham had taken Lot in as a child when Lot’s father had died, treated him as a son, given him first choice of the land, and saved him from an invading army, risking his own life. But, Abraham was bound to think, after this experience of judgment upon Sodom, if he had been a stronger witness to Lot’s family, perhaps some would have been saved.
Now, the subject of this great passage is: Abraham Was Visited by God Himself (Part 2): Intercessory Faith—the Steps to Becoming an Intercessor, a Prayer Warrior, 18:16–33.
1.	Step 1: yearning to walk with God step by step, longing for His presence (v. 16).
2.	Step 2: thinking of God’s great call and purpose for one’s life (vv. 17–19).
3.	Step 3: sensing the pain of God’s heart over wickedness (vv. 20–21).
4.	Step 4: standing boldly before the Lord in prayer—refusing to leave the Lord’s presence (vv. 22–26).
5.	Step 5: laying hold of the open access (door) into God’s presence (vv. 27–28).

Intercession: How does a person become an intercessor, a prayer warrior? By yearning to walk with God step by step, longing for His presence. Remember, the Lord and two angels had appeared to Abraham at the door of his tent, and they had spent a good deal of time with him. Now the Lord and the two angels arose, looked down toward Sodom, and began to walk toward the city. Note, Abraham joined them. He did not have to follow them; he could have stayed behind at his tent. But this he did not do. Abraham joined the Lord as He walked away to begin the journey toward Sodom. Why? Because Abraham just did not want to leave the Lord’s presence. He had tasted (experienced) the closest bond of friendship imaginable with the Lord …
•	a strong sense of friendship and fellowship with God (Ge. 18:1–8)
•	a strong assurance of God’s promises (Ge. 18:10–14)
•	a deep awareness of God’s unlimited power (Ge. 18:10)
The deep sense of friendship, fellowship, and assurance of God’s power all swelled up within Abraham’s heart, and he just did not want the experience to end. He wanted to spend as much time as he could in God’s presence so he walked along with the Lord step by step.
Thought 1. A true intercessor wants to walk along with the Lord step by step and longs for God’s presence. He yearns to develop the closest, most intimate friendship possible with the Lord. Therefore, he seeks and makes opportunity …
•	to turn his thoughts to the Lord throughout the day.
•	to captivate every thought, focusing upon things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of a good report (Ph. 4:8).
•	to set aside blocks of time for concentrated, uninterrupted prayer—every day.
Simply stated, the intercessor wants and longs for God’s presence, to walk along with God step by step, all day and all night long. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 94). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Believer, Duty: How does a person become an intercessor, a prayer warrior? By thinking of God’s great call and purpose for one’s life. Note what the Lord did: He spoke softly to Himself, yet loud enough so that Abraham could hear (see v. 23). Why? There are three reasons.
a. Abraham needed to think of his God-given call and purpose (v. 18). He was to father a great and powerful nation; moreover, all the nations of the earth were to be blessed through him, through the promised seed, the Savior of the world, who was to be a descendant of his. Note what God was arousing within Abraham: a sense of responsibility for the world. God was about to execute His justice upon Sodom and Gomorrah—destroy it—because of their terrible wickedness. God wanted Abraham to sense a responsibility for both the righteous and the wicked; God wanted Abraham stirred to intercede—to struggle and wrestle in prayer—for the cities of the earth. Abraham had a responsibility—a part—in the lives of his fellow men, both the righteous and the wicked. He must, therefore, be aroused to pray for them, even to the point of struggling in prayer.
b. Abraham needed to think of his duty to teach the ways of the Lord, to teach what is right and just (v. 19). Abraham was soon to witness the justice of God falling upon Sodom and Gomorrah. God wanted Abraham to understand God’s ways, that He always does what is right and just, and God wanted Abraham to teach the ways of God. Thus God reminded Abraham of his teaching duties, reminded him right before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
c. Abraham needed to think of faithfulness and of the reward for being faithful. God made great promises to Abraham, and He was going to bring about these promises. But Abraham needed to remember: he was to be faithful; he was to teach the ways of the Lord. Then and only then would the Lord reward him; then and only then would Abraham receive the promises.
Thought 1. Focusing upon the same three subjects will stir us to become intercessors for God:
(1)	Thinking about God’s great call and purpose. God has called us to know the promised seed, the Savior, and to make Him known. We have a responsibility, a part, in the lives of our fellow men, both the righteous and the wicked. We must, therefore, be aroused to pray for them, even to the point of struggling in prayer.
(2)	Thinking about our duty to teach the ways of the Lord. We need to pray and pray much—intercede for ourselves and for others—if we are going to teach the ways of God.
(3)	Thinking about our great need to be faithful and the great reward promised us if we are faithful. We can never walk faithfully without God’s help; thus we need to be constantly praying, even interceding, for God’s help. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 95). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

•	God wanted to teach all believers of succeeding generations to follow Abraham’s example in crying out—in becoming intercessors—for the souls of people.
•	God wanted to teach all people that God is longsuffering and full of mercy, not willing that any person perish, but His mercy is open only to those who believe in Him and receive His mercy. Remember that God had given Sodom and Gomorrah every chance in the world to repent and turn to Him. They had a chance to repent when Abraham freed them from captivity to the invading army from the east (Ge. 14:1–16; 14:17–24); when Melchizedek, the priest of God, bore testimony to them (Ge. 14:18–20); and through the testimony of Lot, weak as his witness was (2 Pe. 2:6–9).
•	God wanted to teach all people that sin leads to judgment, and judgment will be executed. God is going to judge the world. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 95–96). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. How can we become an intercessor, a prayer warrior? By standing boldly before the Lord in prayer and by appealing to His justice. God will always do what is right and just. God will never judge a person beyond that which he deserves. Every person will receive exactly what he deserves, nothing more and nothing less. God’s justice will be executed upon every person, but it will be perfect justice. God will do what is right and just, perfectly so.
“Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need” (He. 4:16).
“In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him [Christ]” (Ep. 3:12).
“Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus” (He. 10:19). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 96). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

5 (18:27–28) Access—Prayer—Intercession: How does a person become an intercessor, a prayer warrior? By laying hold of the open access—the open door—into God’s presence. No doubt, all the wickedness within the cities began to engross Abraham’s mind, and he began to wonder if there were anywhere close to fifty righteous people within the city. Apparently, he felt that if he asked only for Lot and his dear family, he would be acting selfishly. And Abraham was not selfish, nor was he concerned only for Lot and his family. What could he do? How could he pray so that God would both save the city and understand that he was not selfish? There was only one way: keep praying and asking God for more and more until He said “No.” But ask God in all humility. Note how Abraham approached the Lord this second time: confessing that he was but dust and ashes. And note the word Lord (Adonai). This is not the personal name for Lord, but rather the more formal title for God. Abraham was appealing to the Lord who is the Sovereign Ruler and Judge of all the earth.
Abraham asked God to spare the city if forty-five righteous were found, and God answered his prayer.

6 (18:29) Prayer—Intercession: How does a person become an intercessor, a prayer warrior? By continuing in prayer, praying on and on and not giving up, but beseeching God. The verse and point is self-explanatory: Abraham asked God to spare the city if forty righteous people were found, and God answered his prayer.
Thought 1. The true intercessor refuses to give up. He continues to pray on and on. This is exactly what Scripture tells us to do.
“Seek the Lord and his strength, seek his face continually” (1 Chr. 16:11).
“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you” (Mt. 7:7).
“Watch [be sleepless] and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak” (Mt. 26:41). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 97). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. Scripture assures us: if we persevere in prayer, God will hear and answer.
“And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint” (Lu. 18:1).
“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto [being sleepless, giving up sleep] with all perseverance and supplication for all saints” (Ep. 6:18).
“Pray without ceasing” (1 Th. 5:17).
“Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord” (Js. 5:13–14). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).

            <Text>Bargaining with God
Genesis 18:16–33; [19:1–38]
Setting the Stage
Theme. We’ve all probably questioned God at some point. When we witness human suffering, we may wonder why He allows such experiences to persist. When disasters inflict tragedy and destruction, we may question why He chooses not to intervene. We wonder what, if anything, devastating situations can teach us about God’s righteousness. We may even go so far as to question whether God is truly just.
This is exactly what Abraham did in Gen 18. After hearing that God was planning to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, he questioned God directly and tried to negotiate pardon for Sodom: Would God still destroy the city if He found 50 righteous people there? What about 45? Would He pardon it for as few as 10? Throughout his bargaining, Abraham wasn’t disrespectful. Rather, his questions showed his concern for upholding God’s reputation for righteousness and justice. In all his negotiating, Abraham’s chief concern was to know, “Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (Gen 18:25 niv). And as a result of Abraham’s actions, God showed him a little more of His character: He is indeed just and merciful, but maybe not in the ways we expect. Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 18:16–33). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.
Literary Context: Abraham’s bargaining with God in Gen 18:16–33 fits into the larger section of Gen 18–19, which begins with three men visiting Abraham and ends with Lot narrowly escaping from the destruction of Sodom. In some ways, though, the story actually began earlier in Abraham’s life, when he and Lot separated (see Gen 13). Lot chose the fertile Jordan Valley, in which Sodom was located, and Abraham took Canaan (Gen 13:5–12). Here, we find the first reference to the wickedness of Sodom (Gen 13:13).
Later, Abraham came to Lot’s defense after a group of Mesopotamian kings sacked Sodom and made off with spoils and captives, including Lot (Gen 14:11–12). Abraham defeated the Mesopotamian kings, rescued his nephew, and restored Sodom’s possessions (Gen 14:13–16). When the king of Sodom failed to show appreciation for Abraham’s intervention, Abraham disassociated himself from the ruler (Gen 14:21–24; see Chapter 3). In establishing the wickedness of Sodom, the narrative sets the stage for its later destruction. Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 18:16–33). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

Historical &amp; Cultural Background: We don’t know the precise locations of Sodom and Gomorrah, though they were most likely situated somewhere around the Dead Sea (“the sea of the salt”; Gen 14:3). The traditional view is that Sodom and the related “cities of the Plain” (Gen 13:12) were on the south end of the Dead Sea. Since Lot escaped to a city called Zoar (Gen 19:22), and there was a city at the southern point of the Dead Sea bearing that name, this location is possible. However, when Lot and Abraham first separated, the text says Lot chose “the plain of the Jordan” (Gen 13:11), which typically refers to the lush Jordan Valley—an area northeast of the Dead Sea. The place name “the Plain” is also used here in the destruction of Sodom episode (Gen 19:17, 25, 28–29) and has been associated with Sodom since Gen 13:12. Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 18:16–33). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

Recent archaeological excavations also support the northern location. Within this “Plain” area, archaeologists have uncovered several small “tells” or mounds containing the ruins of ancient cities. Nearby is a much larger tell thought to be the most prominent of all the cities of the Plain—Sodom—now known as Tell el-Hammam.
Archaeologists digging at Tell el-Hammam have uncovered a layer of ash nearly six-and-a-half feet deep in certain places. Within this ash layer, they’ve found various artifacts believed to be from the time of Abraham. They’ve also found the remains of bodies and artifacts that have been smashed and burned, but not in a manner typical of warfare or earthquakes. Archaeologists describe “skeletons covered by architectural debris, limbs twisted out of normal positions, some thrown on their faces with hyperextended joints, and surrounded in the matrix by human bone scatter such as pieces of ribs, the ends of long bones, and skull fragments.” The remains may tell the story of Gen 19—a catastrophe Abraham was trying to prevent.
Ultimately, Abraham’s bargaining on behalf of Sodom was not enough to spare the city. God couldn’t find at least 10 righteous people (Gen 18:32), and He rained fire and brimstone on both Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 19:24–25). Yet Abraham’s intercession did result in Lot being spared. As Abraham looked down on the ashes of the cities, the story tells us that “God remembered Abraham” and delivered Lot from the destruction (Gen 19:28–29). For several generations, this layer of ash and its remains reminded people of God’s deliverance for the righteous and His wrath against the wicked. Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 18:16–33). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

A Closer Look
This story begins with Abraham accompanying his three visitors as they depart (Gen 18:16). When they reached a place where they could look down on the city of Sodom, God deliberated—either to Himself or to the three visitors—about whether He should inform Abraham of His plans to destroy the city (Gen 18:17). As He was considering, God repeated to Himself the promise He made to Abraham (Gen 18:18–19).
While previously God articulated the promise several times, this is the only time He voiced the promise without Abraham as His audience (see Gen 12:1–3, 7; 13:14–17; 15:1–21; 17:1–21). God began by reflecting on an aspect of the promise that had been present from the start: that Abraham would become a great and mighty nation that would bless all the nations of the earth (Gen 18:18; see 12:2–3).

God then stated, “I have chosen [Abraham]” (Gen 18:19). With this statement, the theme of divine election—implicit in the narrative thus far—becomes an explicit aspect of Abraham’s story and experience as well as that of God’s chosen people (see Deut 7:6–8). God’s individual election of Abraham would eventually develop into God’s collective election of Israel. In both Abraham’s life and the life of the Israel, election entails blessing and protection for the chosen (Deut 4:39; Isa 65:9), as well as an expectation of obedience to the One who elects (Deut 4:40; 7:9–11; Amos 3:2).

Quick Bit The Hebrew word tsedeq (often translated “righteousness”) is often used to refer to what is right or fair (see Lev 19:36). When translated as “justice,” it carries a legal sense of innocence (see Deut 16:20). In his speeches, for example, Job claimed that his “vindication,” or tsedeq, was at stake (Job 6:29). Often, tsedeq is used to refer to God’s “righteous” or “just” judgments (Psa 9:7–8; Jer 11:20). It appears with mishpat, or “judgment,” in many instances (Psa 33:5; Prov 1:3; Isa 56:1).


God continued by discussing why He chose Abraham. In His previous reiterations of the promise, He had revealed only the results of its fulfillment: that Abraham would have many descendants, become a great nation, and be a blessing. Here, He added a reason: God chose Abraham “to do righteousness and justice” (Gen 18:19b). Abraham was to instruct his children and his entire household in God’s ways, in righteousness, and in justice. God was about to give Abraham an opportunity to debate these topics, as these very themes would drive Abraham in his intercession for Sodom.
When God told Abraham that He was considering destroying Sodom and Gomorrah because of their sin, Abraham was troubled. He had risked his life to help these cities when he defeated the Mesopotamian kings in Gen 14 (see Chapter 3). Even so, Abraham’s chief concern centered on God’s righteousness and justice.
Abraham’s first question to God demonstrates his concern for justice: “Will you also sweep away the righteous with the wicked?” (Gen 18:23). Abraham was distressed that in destroying Sodom, God might also destroy any righteous people living there. Such an act would violate God’s righteousness and justice since He would be destroying persons undeserving of such punishment.

Quick Bit The Hebrew word mishpat means “justice” or “judgment.” It can refer to laws (Psa 119:7) or the carrying out of legal decisions, as in “executing justice” or “bringing someone into judgment” (Psa 146:7; Eccl 12:14). Proverbs claims that evil men cannot understand mishpat—only those who seek God can (Prov 28:5). God’s mishpat includes both condemning the guilty and vindicating the righteous (1 Kgs 8:32).


Abraham used strong language to voice his disapproval, twice repeating, “Far be it from you …” (Gen 18:25). This phrase is a strong way of expressing disapproval, equivalent to saying “certainly not.” David later used this phrase to emphasize that he refused to harm Saul, God’s anointed one (1 Sam 26:11). Abraham’s use of the phrase expresses how unthinkable it seemed to him that God, the just Judge of the earth, would destroy the innocent along with the guilty. He began by asking God to spare the city if there were 50 righteous people in it (Gen 18:24).
After God agreed to this request (Gen 18:26), Abraham started to bargain for lower numbers. He did so with respect and humility, recognizing his position before God (“I am dust and ashes”; Gen 18:27) and being careful not to overstep his place (“Please, let not my Lord be angry”; Gen 18:30, 32). Each time he spoke, Abraham asked that God spare the city for the sake of fewer righteous people. With each lower number, Abraham demonstrated greater faith in God’s mercy as he asked God to spare an entire city of wicked people for the sake of only a few righteous.

We don’t know why the negotiation ended at 10 righteous people (Gen 18:32). It is possible that the number 10 represented totality for the author of the story. Regardless of the reason, Abraham had made his point by the time the bargaining ended. He had appealed to God’s mercy, and God had agreed to spare the entire city for the sake of 10 righteous people.
It is important to note that Abraham didn’t try to convince God to change His plans. As one scholar says, “Abraham was not trying to talk God into doing something against his will, for he was convinced of the righteousness of God.” God’s justice would prohibit Him from punishing the innocent, and His mercy would allow Him to save the wicked from punishment. Abraham, who was chosen “to do righteousness and justice” and to instruct his descendants to do the same (Gen 18:19), showed a clear understanding of these facets of God’s character.
Ultimately, Sodom lacked even 10 righteous people, and God destroyed both Sodom and Gomorrah by raining down fire and brimstone (Gen 19:24–25). Even so, Abraham’s intercession was not futile. God showed His mercy in a way that exceeded Abraham’s negotiation.
After the cities’ destruction, Abraham returned to the place where he had negotiated with God and looked down on the ashes where the cities once stood. At this point, the narrative explains that when God destroyed the cities, He “remembered Abraham” and delivered Lot (Gen 19:29). The term zakhar, meaning “to remember,” is often used in the context of God remembering and staying loyal to His covenant (Exod 2:24; Psa 105:8). Here, it speaks to the privileged position Abraham held (“I have chosen him”; Gen 18:19) and indicates that God demonstrated mercy in the midst of judgment.
Study Questions
1.	God chose Abraham “to do righteousness and justice” and to teach his descendants to keep the way of God. In what ways does your life reflect these aspects of God’s character? How can you better demonstrate God’s righteousness and justice to others?

2.	Think of tragedies or injustices you have seen or experienced. Did they cause you to doubt the justice of God? Have you ever experienced a situation, like Abraham, where you questioned God? What have these experiences taught you about His nature? Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 18:16–33). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

Application
We don’t often approach God the way Abraham did in Gen 18:16–33. We tend to be leery of questioning or negotiating with Him. It seems disrespectful or even sacrilegious to question God or voice our discontent. However, the Bible contains many examples of people who did just that—and they did so in a respectful manner.

Sometimes we try to bargain with God. We promise certain behaviors or actions if God will grant our requests. This type of bargaining shows a faulty understanding of what God desires. When Abraham negotiated with God, he did not do so based on what he could bring. He did not say, “God, if you spare Sodom, I’ll offer extra sacrifices.” Instead, Abraham negotiated based on God’s character, appealing to His justice and righteousness. In doing so, Abraham showed that he understood what is important to God.
Other righteous people in the Bible also focused on God’s character when they approached God. When Moses asked God to refrain from punishing Israel for the golden calf incident, he appealed specifically to God’s reputation and His faithfulness, asking God how it would look to the Egyptians if He destroyed His own people (Exod 32:12). The psalmists wrestled with suffering and pain and presented their complaints to God, yet always with a focus on His character. Even Job’s complaints were based on a view of God’s attributes; Job could not reconcile his understanding of God’s righteousness with the severe suffering he was experiencing.
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus encouraged His followers to approach God in prayer. God is not afraid of our questions; He wants to talk with us and hear our struggles. We can tell Him exactly what we are going through and trust that He understands our concerns and weaknesses. Yet Jesus also instructed His followers to put God first—to “seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness” (Matt 6:33 esv). God may not respond in the way we expect or want Him to, and we will not always understand how His mercy and grace is working to faithfully complete His work in our lives (1 Cor 13:12; Phil 1:6). However, we can be confident that the Judge of all the earth will do right.
Study Questions
1.	How can a fuller understanding of the character of God enhance your prayer life? Does thinking about who God is change the way you pray? In what ways?

2.	Do you know anyone—in your church or in your family—who demonstrates these facets of God’s character? Have you ever known them to question God? What could you learn from their experience?

Genesis 17:1–18:15
Setting the Stage
Theme. While it’s easy to pay lip service to the idea that God is all powerful, it’s much more difficult to consistently live out our faith in ways that recognize God’s unlimited ability—His omnipotence. Like other characteristics attributed to God, omnipotence can be a difficult idea to wrap our heads around. The story of Abram and Sarai shows that even the heroes of faith sometimes found it difficult to acknowledge God’s power in their lives.
In Genesis 17 and 18, Sarai and Abram struggled to keep their composure when God delivered the seemingly ridiculous news that Sarai—a 90-year-old woman who had been barren her whole life—would give birth to a son. In response to Sarai’s laughter of disbelief, God raised the issue of His omnipotence, asking, “Is anything too difficult for Yahweh?” (Gen 18:14). The story goes on to show that “with God all things are possible” (Matt 19:22), even when we have trouble believing it. God eventually made Sarai a mother, demonstrating His ability to bring life from a previously lifeless womb—and He did so despite the couple’s doubts.
Literary Context. As we’ve seen, God repeated His promise to Abram several times throughout his life. Each time, God made the promise more specific. He first promised Abram that he would become a “great nation” (Gen 12:1–3) and identified the land that He would give to Abram’s offspring (Gen 12:7). Later, He revealed that Abram’s descendants would be as numerous as the dust of the earth (Gen 13:14–17). Even later, He made it known that the heir to the promise would be Abram’s own son (Gen 15:4) and identified the specific location of the promised land (Gen 15:18–21).

In Genesis 17:1–27, God again reaffirmed His promise to Abram. While most of this promise resembled earlier versions, a few things were new. God stated that kings would be included among Abram’s descendants (Gen 17:6, 16) and emphasized that a son birthed by Sarai would inherit the covenant (Gen 17:19). Here, God also changed the names of Abram and Sarai to Abraham and Sarah and established circumcision as the sign of the covenant.
In the chapter that follows, three men visit Abraham on their way to Sodom (Gen 18:1–15). While we are told that “Yahweh appeared to [Abraham]” (Gen 18:1), the chapter does not identify the three men or provide details about their interaction with Abraham (they appear in Gen 18:2). Rather, it focuses on Abraham’s hospitality; he invited the men to rest and provided a feast for them (Gen 18:3–8). These men are typically understood as messengers from God or a representation of God Himself (see “Beyond the Bible”).
Historical &amp; Cultural Background. The story of Gen 18 illustrates the significance of hospitality in the ancient Near East. The Babylonian Talmud says, “Greater value attaches to hospitality … than receiving the presence of God.” Hosts were responsible for protecting their guests as well as providing water (so visitors could wash their feet) and a meal (see Gen 24:32; 43:24; Judg 19:21). They were also expected to care for their guests’ animals (see Gen 24:31–32; 43:24).

Quick Bit The Babylonian Talmud is a rabbinic commentary on the Jewish law written between ad 500 and 600. The Hebrew word talmud means “instruction, learning.”


The social and cultural significance of hospitality is also evident in the Psalms, which sometimes portray God as a host. Psalm 23 describes the provision and protection that comes with being a guest in the house of Yahweh; it tells how God satisfies the psalmist’s hunger by setting a “table” before him and provides him with sanctuary by doing so “in the presence of [his] oppressors” (Psa 23:5–6). Psalm 36:8 likewise describes the refreshment that comes to those who take refuge in God’s house.
The Gospel writers also used the role of host in their portrayal of Jesus and His ministry. Jesus practiced hospitality by providing food for the crowds that had been following Him (Mark 8:1–9). He also served as a host when washing His disciples’ feet; earlier, He had criticized a Pharisee for not providing Him with this service (John 13:3–5; see Luke 7:44–47). Understanding ancient Near Eastern hospitality helps us better understand not only Abraham’s story, but other biblical passages as well.
A Closer Look
Genesis 17 opens by telling us “Abram was ninety-nine years old” when Yahweh appeared to him again (Gen 17:1). Thirteen years had passed since the events of Gen 15–16 (see Gen 16:16), yet the narrative doesn’t focus on this fact. Instead, it simply presents God’s reiteration of the promise. This shows that the relationship between the events of Gen 16 and 17 is more important than when the events of each chapter occurred. Previously, Sarai had tried to bring about the fulfillment of God’s promise by providing Abram with an heir through Hagar. Here, as we’ll see, God affirmed that Sarai herself would bear a son. This particular arrangement of events emphasizes the themes of promise and faith in Abram and Sarai’s life.

Quick Tip Storytelling relies on strategic and selective emphasis on important events or scenes. Biblical stories are not random collections of events or partial reminiscences about ancient figures—they are scenes in a larger narrative, carefully crafted to demonstrate God’s faithfulness to His people. The events of Abram’s life presented in Genesis represent important milestones in Abram and Sarai’s journey of faith.


The chapter begins with God once more interacting directly with Abram, identifying Himself as “El-Shaddai” or “God Almighty” (Gen 17:1). In His previous encounters with Abram, God had required very little from him (see Gen 12, 15). Here, God commanded that Abram “walk before me and be blameless,” establishing Abram’s obedience as a condition of His blessing and covenant (Gen 17:1–2).

God also restated the promise and reinstated the covenant—a course of action required by the events of Gen 16. The time for fulfillment of the promise was drawing near. God’s reassurance to Abram in Gen 15 had focused on the promise of the land (see Chapter 4, “A Closer Look”). In this reinstatement of the covenant promise, God emphasized that Abram would be the “father of a multitude of nations” (Gen 17:4–5). God had already attempted to give Abram some sense of how numerous his descendants would be, comparing their number to the dust of the earth (Gen 13:16) and the stars of the sky (Gen 15:5). Here, He emphasized that Abram would father not only a “great nation,” but a “multitude” of them (Gen 17:4). To underscore this promise, God renamed him Abraham, connecting his new name to the promise that he would father this multitude (Gen 17:5). No longer would Abraham merely be a revered figure; he would become the ancestor to whom many people groups would trace their beginning.

Quick Bit The name Abram means “Exalted Father.” The name Abraham is explained in Gen 17:5 as meaning “father of a multitude of nations.” This meaning for Abraham is probably based on the wordplay between av (“father”) and the words raham and hamon, both of which mean “multitude.” This name served a daily reminder of Abraham’s ultimate destiny.


God then introduced circumcision by commanding Abraham, “you must keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations” (Gen 17:9). Previously, the covenant simply established that Canaan would belong to Abraham’s descendants (Gen 15:18–21). Now, the covenant required obedience to God’s command that every male be circumcised. As “a sign of the covenant,” circumcision functioned as a symbol—an external act of obedience that testified to an inward faith in God’s promise (Gen 17:11). The symbolism of circumcision had a lasting impact on biblical writers (see “Throughout the Bible”).
After providing details on circumcision (Gen 17:11–14), God renamed Sarai, calling her Sarah (both names mean “princess”; Gen 17:15). Then, God finally provided Abraham with the essential detail: The promised son would be born through Sarah (Gen 17:16). As if to emphasize the link between His promise to Abraham and His blessing of Sarah, God continued by stating that nations and kings would come through her (Gen 17:16). Stunned by this revelation, Abraham laughed, wondering how an elderly couple could have children (Gen 17:17). He then addressed God, begging Him to bless his son, Ishmael, instead (Gen 17:18). But God’s plan was set: Isaac would be the son of the promise (Gen 17:19, 21).
After 24 years of waiting on God, Abraham finally received a concrete timeframe: Sarah would have a son within the year (Gen 17:21). With this final assurance in place, Abraham proceeded to circumcise every male in his household, as God commanded (Gen 17:23).
In the scene that follows, Abraham offered hospitality to three divine messengers (Gen 18:1–15), who repeated the promise that Sarah would have a son within the year (Gen 18:10). This episode focuses on Sarah’s response to this prophecy: Upon overhearing their announcement, she laughed in disbelief. While Sarah’s reaction is understandable, given her age and lifelong inability to conceive, Yahweh chastised Sarah for her doubt (Gen 18:13). Sarah denied her reaction, likely out of surprise over the scolding and for having the visitor know her thoughts (Gen 18:15).
As the story ends, the sense of immediacy in this selective presentation of events from Abraham’s life becomes apparent (Gen 16–18:15). Abram may have patiently waited on God during the 13 years between Gen 16 and 17. Perhaps he had assumed Ishmael would be his heir and that God had approved of their intervention via Hagar (implied by his reaction in Gen 17:18). Ultimately, however, these stories show that God seems to take delight in performing the impossible.

Genesis 17:1–18:15
Setting the Stage
Theme. While it’s easy to pay lip service to the idea that God is all powerful, it’s much more difficult to consistently live out our faith in ways that recognize God’s unlimited ability—His omnipotence. Like other characteristics attributed to God, omnipotence can be a difficult idea to wrap our heads around. The story of Abram and Sarai shows that even the heroes of faith sometimes found it difficult to acknowledge God’s power in their lives.
In Genesis 17 and 18, Sarai and Abram struggled to keep their composure when God delivered the seemingly ridiculous news that Sarai—a 90-year-old woman who had been barren her whole life—would give birth to a son. In response to Sarai’s laughter of disbelief, God raised the issue of His omnipotence, asking, “Is anything too difficult for Yahweh?” (Gen 18:14). The story goes on to show that “with God all things are possible” (Matt 19:22), even when we have trouble believing it. God eventually made Sarai a mother, demonstrating His ability to bring life from a previously lifeless womb—and He did so despite the couple’s doubts.
Literary Context. As we’ve seen, God repeated His promise to Abram several times throughout his life. Each time, God made the promise more specific. He first promised Abram that he would become a “great nation” (Gen 12:1–3) and identified the land that He would give to Abram’s offspring (Gen 12:7). Later, He revealed that Abram’s descendants would be as numerous as the dust of the earth (Gen 13:14–17). Even later, He made it known that the heir to the promise would be Abram’s own son (Gen 15:4) and identified the specific location of the promised land (Gen 15:18–21).

In Genesis 17:1–27, God again reaffirmed His promise to Abram. While most of this promise resembled earlier versions, a few things were new. God stated that kings would be included among Abram’s descendants (Gen 17:6, 16) and emphasized that a son birthed by Sarai would inherit the covenant (Gen 17:19). Here, God also changed the names of Abram and Sarai to Abraham and Sarah and established circumcision as the sign of the covenant.
In the chapter that follows, three men visit Abraham on their way to Sodom (Gen 18:1–15). While we are told that “Yahweh appeared to [Abraham]” (Gen 18:1), the chapter does not identify the three men or provide details about their interaction with Abraham (they appear in Gen 18:2). Rather, it focuses on Abraham’s hospitality; he invited the men to rest and provided a feast for them (Gen 18:3–8). These men are typically understood as messengers from God or a representation of God Himself (see “Beyond the Bible”).
Historical &amp; Cultural Background. The story of Gen 18 illustrates the significance of hospitality in the ancient Near East. The Babylonian Talmud says, “Greater value attaches to hospitality … than receiving the presence of God.” Hosts were responsible for protecting their guests as well as providing water (so visitors could wash their feet) and a meal (see Gen 24:32; 43:24; Judg 19:21). They were also expected to care for their guests’ animals (see Gen 24:31–32; 43:24).

Quick Bit The Babylonian Talmud is a rabbinic commentary on the Jewish law written between ad 500 and 600. The Hebrew word talmud means “instruction, learning.”


The social and cultural significance of hospitality is also evident in the Psalms, which sometimes portray God as a host. Psalm 23 describes the provision and protection that comes with being a guest in the house of Yahweh; it tells how God satisfies the psalmist’s hunger by setting a “table” before him and provides him with sanctuary by doing so “in the presence of [his] oppressors” (Psa 23:5–6). Psalm 36:8 likewise describes the refreshment that comes to those who take refuge in God’s house.
The Gospel writers also used the role of host in their portrayal of Jesus and His ministry. Jesus practiced hospitality by providing food for the crowds that had been following Him (Mark 8:1–9). He also served as a host when washing His disciples’ feet; earlier, He had criticized a Pharisee for not providing Him with this service (John 13:3–5; see Luke 7:44–47). Understanding ancient Near Eastern hospitality helps us better understand not only Abraham’s story, but other biblical passages as well.
A Closer Look
Genesis 17 opens by telling us “Abram was ninety-nine years old” when Yahweh appeared to him again (Gen 17:1). Thirteen years had passed since the events of Gen 15–16 (see Gen 16:16), yet the narrative doesn’t focus on this fact. Instead, it simply presents God’s reiteration of the promise. This shows that the relationship between the events of Gen 16 and 17 is more important than when the events of each chapter occurred. Previously, Sarai had tried to bring about the fulfillment of God’s promise by providing Abram with an heir through Hagar. Here, as we’ll see, God affirmed that Sarai herself would bear a son. This particular arrangement of events emphasizes the themes of promise and faith in Abram and Sarai’s life.

Application
The story of Abraham and Sarah’s life is not simply about the unfolding of God’s promise and faithfulness to the patriarchal couple; it is the story of God revealing Himself to those attempting to follow His promise. It is a story of discovering God’s character.

When God called Abraham out of Ur, Abraham unquestioningly followed Him (Gen 12:1). Yet decades later, when God announced that Sarah would have a son in her old age, both Abraham and Sarah responded with laughter, unable to suppress their doubt (Gen 17:17; 18:12). Abraham and Sarah didn’t have the full picture of God’s plan, but their laughter also revealed that they did not have a full understanding of the extent of God’s power. They had not yet learned that nothing is too difficult for Yahweh (Gen 18:14).
When faced with challenges in our journey of faith, it may become difficult to imagine how God’s unlimited ability will pull us through. When we experience loss or pain, we may be unable to place our confidence in God’s goodness. In these cases, we can turn to the Bible to see how God’s power and grace manifested in the lives of those who followed Him. The Bible does not simply describe God’s involvement with humankind—it describes who God is. And, like Abraham and Sarah, we can grow in our understanding of God’s character as He reveals Himself to us in the story of our lives.

            <Text>Genesis 18
1 And the Lord appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day. 
2 He lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing in front of him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth 
3 and said, “O Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. 
4 Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree, 
5 while I bring a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—since you have come to your servant.” So they said, “Do as you have said.” 
6 And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quick! Three seahs of fine flour! Knead it, and make cakes.” 
7 And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man, who prepared it quickly. 
8 Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and set it before them. And he stood by them under the tree while they ate. 
9 They said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “She is in the tent.” 
10 The Lord said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door behind him. 
11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in years. The way of women had ceased to be with Sarah. 
12 So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, “After I am worn out, and my lord is old, shall I have pleasure?” 
13 The Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’ 
14 Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son.” 
15 But Sarah denied it, saying, “I did not laugh,” for she was afraid. He said, “No, but you did laugh.” 
16 Then the men set out from there, and they looked down toward Sodom. And Abraham went with them to set them on their way. 
17 The Lord said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do, 
18 seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 
19 For I have chosen him, that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice, so that the Lord may bring to Abraham what he has promised him.” 

20 Then the Lord said, “Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great and their sin is very grave, 
21 I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry that has come to me. And if not, I will know.” 
22 So the men turned from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham still stood before the Lord. 
23 Then Abraham drew near and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? 
24 Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city. Will you then sweep away the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? 
25 Far be it from you to do such a thing, to put the righteous to death with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?” 
26 And the Lord said, “If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake.” 
27 Abraham answered and said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes. 
28 Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?” And he said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.” 
29 Again he spoke to him and said, “Suppose forty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of forty I will not do it.” 
30 Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there.” He answered, “I will not do it, if I find thirty there.” 
31 He said, “Behold, I have undertaken to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.” 
32 Then he said, “Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there.” He answered, “For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.” 
33 And the Lord went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

            <Title>The Hospitality of Abraham</Title>
            <Text>“And the Lord appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day” (Genesis 18:1). When Abraham saw three men approaching his tents, he eagerly ran out to meet them. Evidently, he recognized them as divine (he addressed them as ‘the Lord’) and in a great display of hospitality he offered to clean their feet, a place to rest and some bread as he prepared a meal of curds, milk, and beef for them. Waltke writes that Abraham’s meal turned “out to be a royal banquet” (p. 267). He gave the best he had to the Lord! Abraham’s response to the divine visitors also showed that he cared about people. He could have ignored the visitors but went out of his way provide relief and comfort from the heat of day. In bowing to the ground before the feet of the Lord, Abraham also showed himself to be humble (18:2). Instead of commanding his servants to be the wait staff, Abraham took the posture of a servant and personally served his visitors. 
Abraham provides to us a great example of how to serve and show hospitality to others. Whenever we encounter someone in need we should be moved by our faith to meet their need without grumbling or complaining, especially the needs of our fellow Christians (Galatians 6:10). The apostle Paul wrote “contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality” (Romans 12:13). The pursuit of hospitality is a mark of the faithful Christian’s life.  In fact, hospitality is listed as one of the character qualifications of an oversee/elder in the Lord’s church (1 Timothy 3:2; Titus 1:8). Arrogance has no place in an elder’s life. God’s leaders must lovingly serve the flock of God in order to lead them. Oftentimes this will require an open door to the home and life of an overseer/elder.
As the Lord dined in the presence of Abraham, He provided more specific details about the end of Sarah’s barrenness: “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife shall have a son” (Genesis 18:10). Sarah, who had entered menopause, laughed to herself in unbelief because both her and Abraham were well advanced in years. She found the Lord’s statement incredible because it was physically impossible to her. The Lord confronted Sarah’s unbelief: “Is anything too hard for the Lord? At the appointed time I will return to you, about this time next year, and Sarah shall have a son” (Genesis 18:14). Sarah made the mistake we often make - focusing on impossible situations, humanly speaking, rather than the power and promises of God. In fear, Sarah tried to cover up her unbelief with a lie (Genesis 18:15). However, she forgot that she was in the presence of the all-knowing God.
Sarah had good reason to doubt because her body was ‘dead’ to childbearing (Romans 4:19). But, we must remember that God’s promises cannot be limited by our reasoning. His power exceeds any limitation we might face in our lives. All things are possible with God. As we seek to live and serve God faithfully, we should remember that with just a little faith in God we can move mountains (Matthew 17:20). Through faith in God, His power enables us to overcome all the difficulties which block our journey. The Lord resources are infinite and open to those of us willing to exercise faith in Him, for “His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence” (2 Peter 1:3).

            <Text>3–5  The emphasis here is on Abraham’s solicitude as host. His actions include giving water to his guests so that they may wash their feet, and offering them rest and food. Once they are refreshed (v. 5), they may continue on their journey. Such hospitality in the ancient Near Eastern world would not be strange. Indeed, its absence would be strange and disturbing. The host is responsible for his guest’s needs and safety as long as the guest remains under his roof. This custom explains Lot’s actions in the following chapter when it is his turn to host a visitor. On an earlier occasion Abraham, when he himself was the visitor, received anything but a hospitable reception from the Egyptians (Gen. 12:10–20).

The masquerade is perpetuated by the visitors. They accept Abraham’s offer: Very well, do as you have spoken. They eat! Like Joseph, who conceals his identity from his brothers, Yahweh and his angels conceal their identity from Abraham. He does not know that he is “entertaining angels unawares” (Heb. 13:2).

It is not necessary to push this story as far as do some commentators, who understand 18:1–15 as a story diluted by the Yahwist from the idea of God eating food to the idea of a meal given to angels unawares. Rather, the eating is a concession by God to Abraham’s ignorance of the one who stands in front of him incognito. In OT thought God inhales the pleasing odor of sacrifice, but he does not consume the sacrifice. Surely it is not without significance that only when Yahweh is in the guise of a wayfarer does he partake of food (18:8; 19:3). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 8–9). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

6–8  Sarah will provide the cakes for the meal, using three seahs of fine flour. 1 Sam. 25:18 tells us Abigail made sufficient provisions for David and his band of outlaws with five seahs of parched grain. The trench Elijah dug around the base of the altar at Mt. Carmel, which was then filled with twelve jars of water, was large enough to hold two seahs of seed (1 K. 18:32). These two references suggest that Sarah’s three seahs is a large amount, which will yield much more bread than the three visitors, Sarah, and Abraham can possibly eat.

Abraham’s extravagance continues. He provides curds and milk (side dishes to bring out the taste of the meat and to diminish their thirst), together with the meat of a tender and choice calf. In other entertainment scenes the host is content to provide “kids of goats” (Gen. 27:9; Judg. 6:19; 13:15). That Abraham provides a calf shows either his relative prosperity and social standing, or his desire to give his best to his guests, or both. Abraham apparently does not share the meal with the threesome: He was standing by them under the tree while they ate. He is both waiter and host. Hamilton, V. P. (1995).

9  Sarah also does not join around the table. Abraham is standing aside, but Sarah is not seen at all. She is still inside the tent. Perhaps it was not proper for females to eat with males. Later, Rachel would be in a tent and would protest to her father that she was not able to rise so that he could search the entire tent because “the manner of women” (lit.; dereḵ nāšîm) was upon her (31:35). Sarah too is in a tent, but for her “the manner of women” (lit.; ʾōraḥ kannāšîm) has ceased (18:11). Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 11). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.


10  All previous promises of a son to Abraham were, to say the least, nebulous and unqualified (e.g., 15:4; 17:16). Now the announcement is more specific. At this time next year Sarah is to have a child. Possibility now gives way to specificity.
It is not clear all that is meant by the phrase I will surely return to you. What does the return of the divine presence to Abraham have to do with Sarah’s conception of Isaac? Gen. 21:1 picks up on this promise: “Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah as he had promised.” A number of OT texts use šûḇ with God as subject, and the idea is to return for the sake of showing favor. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 12). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

11  Abraham’s earlier protestations regarding fathering a child had focused on his problem (15:4), or on the advanced age of both prospective parents (17:17). Also, such protestations occurred in Abraham’s direct discourse. But here it is the narrator who speaks. He knows Abraham and Sarah are advanced in years and Sarah has reached menopause. This phrase reinforces the advanced stage of Sarah. She was not just old or older, but at a point where her menses had ceased. This verse and the following two place special emphasis on the ages of Abraham and Sarah by the three-time use of the root zqn. The narrator calls both of them “elderly” (zeqēnîm, v. 11), a point made by Sarah about Abraham (zāqēn, v. 12) and about herself (zāqantî, v. 13). The narrator simply states the biological facts. The narrator, while he does not succumb to an outburst of laughter as Abraham did, and as Sarah shortly will, through such asides, injects his own sense of humor and the incredulous into the story. As Sternberg has said, “In his interpolated aside on the age of the prospective parents, he [v. 12, the narrator] goes out of his way to give color to Sarah’s laughter at the visitor’s forecast: the more natural her doubt, the stronger our sense of God’s supernatural prescience.” Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 12). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

13  Sarah has overheard the anonymous visitor talking to her husband. Now the tables are turned—the visitor overhears Sarah talking to herself. Here the speaker is identified: Yahweh. That explains how he knew Sarah’s name, and how he hears her quite distinctly here, even though she laughed inwardly and was probably muttering to herself.

For such a response Yahweh takes Sarah to task, through her husband: Why did Sarah laugh? She is not spoken to directly. Furthermore, Yahweh knows quite well what Sarah had meant by “pleasure,” as is evident from his interpretative quotation of her: Will I really give birth, even though I am old? That is what Sarah had in mind, but that is not exactly how she said it. She had drawn attention to both her own age and her husband’s advanced years (v. 12). Yahweh has Sarah drawing attention to her own advanced age. He discreetly avoids any reference to Abraham the centenarian, for conceivably a man might father a child even at such an age.

It may seem odd that Yahweh rebukes Sarah for her reservations but does not challenge Abraham for his doubts. We had mentioned earlier that 18:10b and 17:19 would, together, suggest that Abraham kept the announcement of Isaac’s conception from Sarah. She hears about it (18:10b) quite by accident. Perhaps the rebuke aimed at Sarah indicates that Abraham had shared the news about Isaac with Sarah, but that she still persisted in unbelief. She was not convinced by her husband. Or perhaps, following Speiser, one should translate ṣāḥaq in 17:17 as “smile,” rather than as a laughter of disbelief (see commentary on 17:17).
14  Here Yahweh himself promises to return to Sarah. Sarah’s laughter and display of incredulity provoked this question from Yahweh: Is anything too demanding [difficult, impossible] for Yahweh? It is a question that neither Abraham nor Sarah tries—or has a chance—to answer. The guest’s first question pointed to Sarah. His second question points to himself. In the latter half of this chapter Yahweh is moved out of the role of interrogator and into the role of respondent when Abraham asks him a rhetorical question: “Shall not he who judges all the earth give right judgment?” (v. 25).

Yahweh’s question to Abraham is designed to shift the patriarchal couple’s obsession beyond their own hopeless situation and their own limited resources to the limitless resources of their God. Note that Sarah’s unbelief does not abort, or sidetrack, or slow down the promise of God. She will still conceive, whether she thinks she can or cannot. To reinforce this certainty, not only does the text repeat in v. 14 the kāʿēṯ ḥayyá (at this time next year) of v. 10 but it adds lammôʿēḏ, at the appointed time. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 13–14). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

15  Because she was afraid. Fear moves people to do things that are irrational and uncharacteristic of them. Adam hid because he was afraid of God. Abraham deceived because he was afraid of what the Egyptians might do to him. Now Sarah is afraid because she has challenged the authenticity of a divine promise and because she has irked the divine visitor. Thus she lies: I did not laugh. A second sin is committed (lying) in an attempt to cover up a first sin (unbelief).

Sarah speaks aloud only once in vv. 1–15—“I did not laugh,” (v. 15), and softly once (v. 12). Only once is she addressed: “No, you laughed.” The conversation stops quickly. Abraham makes no contribution to the dialogue between Yahweh and Sarah. By ending on such a note, Yahweh intends for Sarah not to dismiss quickly remembrance of her laughter over the announcement of her forthcoming conception. In effect, Yahweh is providing Sarah with a “recondite hint of the name of the child.” Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (p. 14). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.

            <Title>The Intercession of Abraham</Title>
            <Text>Abraham and the Lord shared an intimate relationship as evidenced by the meal they shared. The Lord’s revelation concerning the impending doom of Sodom and Gomorrah also highlights the close fellowship they shared - “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?” (Genesis 18:17). Just as we share our intimate thoughts and plans with only close family and friends, the Lord shares His plan with Abraham because they are friends.  
Furthermore, the Lord revealed His plans to Abraham because he would be the most influential man in God’s plan of redemption for the world. However prior to being a blessing to the nations, he will be a blessing to his own family and progeny. God knew that Abraham would command his children and household to keep the way of the Lord by living righteously and justly (Genesis 18:19). Because of his relationship with the Lord, Abraham passed down God’s will for right living to his descendants. Though not sinless, Abraham’s faith in God led him to promote the spiritual health of his family and household. God’s plan for mankind is that His ways be passed down through the generations within the home (Deuteronomy 6:6; Proverbs 1:8). God has entrusted Christian fathers with the responsibility of raising children in the way of the Lord: “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord” (Ephesians 6:4). Satan’s strategy includes distracting fathers (parents) from the all-important responsibility of teaching and training their children to live according to God’s will. Our children’ spiritual development does not exclude but is more important than their physical health, academic achievement, social status, career prospects, etc. 
When the Lord told Abraham that He intends to bring destruction upon the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham intercedes for the righteous who might be caught in the impending judgment, specifically Lot (18:23-32). Starting at fifty, Abraham bargains with God to spare the cities if He found that number of righteous people there. The Lord finally agrees to spare Sodom if even ten righteous people could be found. Such bargaining (intercession) highlights the close relationship Abraham enjoyed with the Lord. Jesus said in John 15:7, “If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.” If we want to have an effective prayer life to be able to intercede like Abraham, fellowship with Christ and obedience to His will are the prerequisites. </Text>

            <Title>Foundation</Title>
            <Text>The wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah had reached such a high level that God decided to judge the cities. He informed Abraham, His friend, of the impending doom, which prompted Abraham to intercede for the righteous of the city. The Lord agreed to withhold judgment if the city contained at least ten righteous people. The two angels who accompanied the Lord’s visit to Abraham went on to Sodom in order to seek out the righteous. This will end up being the last act of mercy extended to the citizens of the wicked cities.
When the two angels get to Sodom they are greeted by Lot at the city gate. The gates of ancient cities served as hubs of the city’s civic, business, and legal activities. They were often well built, large areas consisting of towers, guards, and places to sit. The city gate was basically the center of the city’s power and activities. The fact that Lot sits at the city gate to greet the visiting angels suggests that he had fully immersed himself into the life and culture of Sodom. He may have even been a leader in Sodom. However, Lot shows himself to be somewhat different from his fellow Sodomites when he extends hospitality to the angels. 
In OT and NT times, the extension of hospitality to others, especially to travelers, demonstrated one’s character and inclination towards God. In defense of his righteousness, Job argued that he opened his home to the traveler (Job 31:32). The Lord, through the prophet Isaiah, scolded Israel for neglecting to show hospitality to the homeless (Isaiah 58:7). Jesus highlighted Simon’s lack of hospitality by comparing the Pharisee’s actions to that of the sinful woman who anointed Jesus (Luke 7:44-46). The rich man demonstrated his greed and selfishness through his inhospitable treatment of the beggar Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31). In Genesis 19, the men of Sodom showed the depravity of their wickedness through their attempt to molest the visiting angels.</Text>

            <Text>Human sin will alway be met by either God’s mercy or judgment. Lot and his family did not merit the opportunity to escape God’s judgment, but we read that the Lord patiently endured Lot’s reluctant to let go of his life in Sodom. Like Lot we have spent many years in vanity and pride, but through God’s great patience, mercy and grace we received salvation.  Let us be mindful that choosing to live by the lusts of the flesh, eyes, and the pride of possessions rather than by faith in the promises of God will create negative consequences in our lives. Small ‘sinful’ decisions can create a slow fade that leads enormous consequences and great loss. We show also take note that the awful extent of human depravity begins will people’s failure to gratefully acknowledge God. When divine restraint is removed from the human heart the levels to which human degeneracy and depravity can descend get very low. God disciplines His children as a loving Father in order to prevent this from happening, but He will judge the impenitent like those in Sodom. </Text>

            <Title>The Wickedness of Sodom</Title>
            <Text> As soon as nightfall, the men of Sodom revealed why they outcry against the city was so great. Before the angels had a chance to lay down, the men of the city, young and old, surrounded Lot’s home and demanded, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them” (Genesis 19:5 ESV). The Hebrew word for “know” is “yada”, which in this context means “to know a person carnally” (Brown-Driver-Briggs, p. 394). It refers to sexual intercourse and is the same word used in Genesis 4:1, where Adam and Eve come together to conceive Cain (see also  Genesis 4:17,25; 24:16; 38:26). It becomes clear from the context that the issue is intercourse when Lot responds by offering his daughters “who have never known a man” (19:8). The picture here is of men so depraved and driven by unnatural lust that they demand to have homosexual sex with Lot’s visitors! The depravity depicted shows the depth to which the human heart can sink. Other notable sins associated with Sodom and Gomorrah in Scripture include social oppression, adultery, lying, criminal enterprise, pride, complacency, and neglect of the poor (Isaiah 1:10,17; Jeremiah 23:14; Ezekiel 16:49). 
In these modern times when homosexual (gay/same-sex) marriage has become legalized and even promoted by some in Christendom as God-honoring, we must resist conformity to the depravity of our age.  Scripture always speaks of homosexual behavior in a negative sense. The Law prohibited homosexual behavior among the Israelites (Leviticus 18:22; 20:13) and the apostle Paul taught that those who practice homosexuality will not inherit the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9). Many have twisted the Scriptures to accommodate the argument that one is “born gay” and therefore intended by God to be gay. However, we must remember that Adam’s sin affected the entire human race both spiritually and physically (Genesis 2:16-17; 3:17-19). From the earliest years of life, if not from birth, the fallen flesh produces sinful desires, including homosexual orientation. We have the choice whether to act upon our sinful desires. Christians have the charge “to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness” (Ephesians 4:22-24).
Having rejected Lot’s offer of his daughters, the men of the city tried to force their way into Lot’s house, but the angels protect Lot and strike the men with blindness. However, the men continue to wear themselves out trying to get into Lot’s house. Such is the nature of sin. Unabated lust seeks to be fulfilled at all costs. If not checked, frustrated desire leads to argumentation, conflict, and even violence (James 4:1-3). All of us are susceptible to perpetually wanting more than we have (covetousness), whether it be money, possessions, sexual fulfillment, etc. We should remember that “Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and never satisfied are the eyes of man” (Proverbs 27:20). </Text>

            <Title>The Escape of Lot</Title>
            <Text>The angels pronounced the final sentence of judgment against Sodom and Gomorrah, commanding Lot to persuade his loved ones to leave the city. He tried to get his daughters’ fiances to leave, but Lot had no moral influence over them. Lot’s personal testimony was so meaningless that they laughed at him (Genesis 19:12-14). Lot was so attached to his home, business, possessions, and status in Sodom that it made it difficult for him to leave. The next morning, the angels had to literally drag Lot, his wife, and their two daughters out of the city (Genesis 19:15-16)! While we might be tempted to say Lot deserved to be left behind, this should remind us of the mercy God has shown us, for “he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit” (Titus 3:5). 
Once they reached the city limits, the angels commanded Lot’s family to run for their lives to hills outside of the city (Genesis 15:17). Amazingly, Lot continued to display a lack of faith by pleading to be allowed to escape to a nearby city (Zoar) because he does not believe he will be protected in the hills. The angel responded “Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there” (Genesis 19:21-22). This accommodation gives us a marvelous picture of God’s grace to very weak and imperfect people. Let us be grateful that “For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly” (Romans 5:6).
When Lot arrived in Zoar, God rained burning sulfur on Sodom, Gomorrah, and the cities of the plain. Unfortunately, Lot’s wife disobeyed the command of the angels: “But Lot’s wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt” (Genesis 19:26). Her love for Sodom, depicted in her staying behind Lot and looking back, led to her inclusion in God’s judgment against the cities of the Plain. Jesus, who compared his future coming and judgment to the destruction of Sodom, warned us to remember Lot’s wife (Luke 17:32). We must urgently cut any attachment to worldly pleasures, wealth, money, possessions, and honor which prevent us from being spiritually prepared for the Lord’s return. When that Day comes, having a big, beautiful home or a million-dollar retirement fund will not be important.

            <Text>God Rescues Lot
19 The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed himself with his face to the earth 2 and said, “My lords, please turn aside to your servant’s house and spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise up early and go on your way.” They said, “No; we will spend the night in the town square.” 3 But he pressed them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house. And he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 


4 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house. 5 And they called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.” 6 Lot went out to the men at the entrance, shut the door after him, 7 and said, “I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly. 8 Behold, I have two daughters who have not known any man. Let me bring them out to you, and do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shelter of my roof.” 9 But they said, “Stand back!” And they said, “This fellow came to sojourn, and he has become the judge! Now we will deal worse with you than with them.” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot, and drew near to break the door down. 10 But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door. 11 And they struck with blindness the men who were at the entrance of the house, both small and great, so that they wore themselves out groping for the door. 


12 Then the men said to Lot, “Have you anyone else here? Sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone you have in the city, bring them out of the place. 13 For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to destroy it.” 14 So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, “Up! Get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city.” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting. 


15 As morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be swept away in the punishment of the city.” 16 But he lingered. So the men seized him and his wife and his two daughters by the hand, the Lord being merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city. 17 And as they brought them out, one said, “Escape for your life. Do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Escape to the hills, lest you be swept away.” 18 And Lot said to them, “Oh, no, my lords. 19 Behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life. But I cannot escape to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me and I die. 20 Behold, this city is near enough to flee to, and it is a little one. Let me escape there—is it not a little one?—and my life will be saved!” 21 He said to him, “Behold, I grant you this favor also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken. 22 Escape there quickly, for I can do nothing till you arrive there.” Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. 
God Destroys Sodom
23 The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar. 24 Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven. 25 And he overthrew those cities, and all the valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground. 26 But Lot’s wife, behind him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt. 
27 And Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord. 28 And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the valley, and he looked and, behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace. 
29 So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in which Lot had lived. 
Lot and His Daughters
30 Now Lot went up out of Zoar and lived in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to live in Zoar. So he lived in a cave with his two daughters. 31 And the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is not a man on earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth. 32 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.” 33 So they made their father drink wine that night. And the firstborn went in and lay with her father. He did not know when she lay down or when she arose. 
34 The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night with my father. Let us make him drink wine tonight also. Then you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve offspring from our father.” 35 So they made their father drink wine that night also. And the younger arose and lay with him, and he did not know when she lay down or when she arose. 36 Thus both the daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father. 37 The firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. 38 The younger also bore a son and called his name Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites to this day.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version.

            <Text>	Abraham Had His Prayer Answered—Lot Was Saved and Sodom Destroyed: The Picture of Backsliding Faith, 19:1–38
(19:1–38) Introduction: remember Lot. He had every advantage imaginable to know the Lord and to live life to the fullest.
⇒	He was taken in and reared by Abraham when Abraham first trusted God and began his journey of faith. But he apparently paid little attention to the testimony and witness of Abraham (Ge. 12:4–5).
⇒	He was given the first choice of land by Abraham, but he chose selfishly and settled close to Sodom (Ge. 13:5–18).
⇒	He was rescued from enslavement when captured by the invading army of kings from the East (Ge. 14:12–16). But instead of returning with Abraham, he chose to return to Sodom.
Lot loved Sodom and the opportunities the city offered him both for business and personal pleasure. Lot coveted the city’s bright lights, the opportunity for wealth, possessions, pleasure, and position. Scripture gives a graphic picture of Lot’s love for Sodom, the declining stages he went through in moving closer and closer to Sodom and its carnal and wicked way of life:
⇒	Lot first of all lifted up his eyes and looked upon Sodom and the rich, fertile valley of the Jordan in which the city sat (Ge. 13:10–11).
⇒	Lot then chose to move, pitching his tent toward Sodom (Ge. 13:12–13).
⇒	Lot later moved into the city (Ge. 14:12).
⇒	Lot finally is seen sitting at the gate of Sodom, which meant that he was most likely some city official (Ge. 19:1).
Lot began the pilgrimage to the promised land with Abraham. But once there, he saw the bright lights and business opportunities of Sodom. Instead of focusing upon the heavenly city—the promised land—he looked and looked at Sodom until the attraction of the city consumed him. Eventually, Lot became one with the city and its ungodly people. Lot’s life is a graphic picture of backsliding, a dangerous threat to us all. Lot was saved, genuinely saved. Scripture says so:
“And [God] delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation [behavior] of the wicked: for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds” (2 Pe. 2:7–8).
But Lot fell back, lived a carnal, fleshly life. He was right at home with the sinful and wicked of the earth. A disheartening picture. Nevertheless, a picture of warning, a graphic picture that warns us of the coming judgment upon all the backsliding believers and the wicked of this earth.
Henry Morris says this:
What a perfect picture Lot exhibits of a modern-day carnal Christian! He thinks he has the best of both worlds—the eternal benefit of knowing the Lord as Savior, but also all the temporal benefits that result from worldly influence and possessions, together with acceptance by and fellowship with men of the world. Their gross wickedness may vex his soul a bit, and he may not wish to enter into quite all of their activities, but in general he gets along with them just fine, and is quite pleased with himself that he does. A day of reckoning will come, however.
This is the subject of this important passage: Abraham Had His Prayer Answered—Lot Was Saved and Sodom Destroyed: The Picture of Backsliding Faith, 19:1–38.
1.	Picture 1: Lot’s compromise with the world (vv. 1–3).
2.	Picture 2: Lot’s depravity (vv. 4–11).
3.	Picture 3: Lot’s powerless life and testimony (vv. 12–14).
4.	Picture 4: Lot’s desire to linger in the world (vv. 15–22).
5.	Picture 5: Lot’s warning of judgment—a lesson for all (vv. 23–26).
6.	Picture 6: Lot’s deliverance—in answer to prayer (vv. 27–29).
7.	Picture 7: Lot’s tragic end—results of backsliding (vv. 30–38). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 99–100). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

1 (19:1–3) Compromise—Worldliness: the first picture of backsliding is Lot’s compromise with the world. Remember, the Lord had stayed behind with Abraham. Only the two angels went to Sodom. They arrived in the evening. Note two facts.
a. Lot sat in the gateway of Sodom. He was there for one of two reasons.
⇒	Lot was either the mayor or a city official responsible for city government and for settling disputes between citizens. City officials, acting as judges, sat at the gate for that purpose (see De. 21:19–21; 22:15; Ruth 4:1; Pr. 31:23). Abraham had saved Sodom from foreign conquest (see Ge. 14:1–24). Perhaps the citizens had honored Lot, making him a city official because of what his uncle had done for them.
⇒	Lot had compromised his values and was now living with the worldly. Perhaps he was at the gate, the public gathering place, either to conduct business or just pass the time away with the worldly. He was “walking in the counsel of the ungodly, standing in the way of sinners, and sitting in the seat of the scornful” (Ps. 1:1; see Ps. 69:12; 2 Pe. 2:8).
b. Lot was a believer, consequently there was some inner goodness within him. There was more to Lot’s invitation than just Eastern social tradition and kindness. There was an urgency, an anxiety in his invitation: he insisted, “pressed … greatly” upon them to accept his invitation (v. 3). He knew the city and the people, the moral degradation. He knew the threat and danger to the strangers—the threat and danger that in fact happened (vv. 4–11). Note that a spiritual awareness, an inner goodness, is still seen even in the midst of Lot’s carnality and failure.
The two angels probably refused the invitation at first because they had come to investigate the wickedness of the city or else out of politeness, not wishing to inconvenience Lot.
Thought 1. J. Vernon McGee gives a descriptive picture and application of the conversation between Lot and the angels:
They had brought out something when they said, “We’ll stay on the street and just sleep in the park,” and Lot says to them, “You don’t do that in Sodom. It’s dangerous! Your life wouldn’t be worth a thing if you did that.” May I say that maybe Los Angeles ought to change its name to Sodom. It would not be safe for you to sleep on the streets of Los Angeles; in fact, it is not safe at all to be on the streets of Los Angeles at night. Many women who live alone will not come out to church at night. One dear saint of God told me, “I just lock my door at dark, Brother McGee, and I do not open that door until the next morning at daylight. It’s not safe in my neighborhood to even walk on the street.” The days of Sodom and Gomorrah are here again, and practically for the same reason. Lot says, “No, men, do not stay on the street. It wouldn’t be safe for you.” When he “pressed upon them,” they came in. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 100–101).

2 (19:4–11) Depravity—Homosexuality—Immorality: the second picture of backsliding is Lot’s depravity. The scene pictured here is shocking. It shows how utterly depraved the human heart can become. But it also shows how far believers can backslide, how carnal and fleshly-minded they can become. These verses give a graphic picture of Lot’s depravity, as well as the depravity of the Sodomites.
a. Lot had chosen a godless, depraved environment when he moved to Sodom (vv. 4–5a). Note that a mob of people from all over the city surrounded Lot’s house. Both young and old burned with unnatural lust: they shouted out their desires for sex, for homosexual sex. The mob was not acting in secret; they were shouting aloud their cravings and sexual preference. They were out to commit homosexual rape against Lot’s visitors.
b. Lot had made his home with the depraved and wicked of the earth, becoming one with them (vv. 6–7). What a tragic picture of backsliding! Note that Lot went outside to meet the mob and called them brothers, friends (v. 7). Lot knew these people: they were his day-to-day friends, acquaintances, neighbors, and business associates. He had lived among the worldly too long; he had no testimony before them. In their minds, he was like them, one of them: loving the world and the things of the world. Thus they expected him to grant their wish.
c. Lot had become consumed with selfishness and compromise (v. 8). This is a horrible, unbelievable scene. Lot offered to give his daughters to the mob in exchange for the guests. How could he do this?
⇒	Was he trying to save his own life, standing there face to face with the mob, fearing their threats?
⇒	Was he so threatened and so fearful that he was in a confused state of mind?
⇒	Did he know that his guests were angels, and he was willing to sacrifice his two daughters to save them?
Scripture does not say, but whatever the case, Lot was only substituting one sin for another sin, the giving up of his daughters to satisfy the evil lusts of the mob. No doubt, being forced to have sex with so many men would have killed his daughters, and Lot would have known this. He was engulfed by a spirit of selfishness and evil compromise.
d. Lot had lived a hypocritical life: he had sat at the gate, judging and reproving the citizens of Sodom for their injustices while living a compromising and worldly life (v. 9). Scripture actually tells us this:
“For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds” (2 Pe. 2:8).
Lot had attempted to influence his fellow citizens for good: he had sat at the city gate as one of the ruling officials of the city, judging and censoring many; but he had lived a worldly, compromising life. Note that the mob actually accused Lot of living a hypocritical life, shouting that they would tolerate it no more. They began to attack him.
Note: a hypocritical, compromising believer—a backsliding believer—will usually be ridiculed, mocked, and eventually rejected, just as Lot was.
e. Lot was delivered by the two angels (vv. 10–11). They struck the mob with some form of blindness and quickly opened the door and pulled Lot back into the house.
Thought 1. Henry Morris gives an excellent application of these verses to our day and time:
The fact that the old men as well as the young were driven by these lusts, and that, rather than practicing them in secret, they shouted their desires aloud in the streets, adds still another dimension to the enormity of the thing. No wonder God had told Abraham that “the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and their sin is very grievous” (18:20). In these modern days, after two thousand years of Christian teaching to which the Sodomites never had access, what must God think of the current revival of homosexuality, manifest in “gay liberation” movements and political organizations, and even “gay” religious societies, not only among liberals, but even among some evangelicals?
“The show [look] of their countenance [face] doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves” (Is. 3:9). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 101).

Deeper Study # 1
(19:4) Sodom: Sodom was located at the southern tip of the Dead Sea, and its ruins are thought to lie under the sea today. The city was destroyed because of sin, especially the sin of sexual perversion (Ge. 13:13, see 18:20; 19:13, 24). The sin for which Sodom is known is homosexuality; in fact, the sin of homosexuality was so common in Sodom that it has become proverbial (sodomy). Sodomy—homosexuality and other forms of sexual perversion—is referred to throughout Scripture when sin and judgment are the subject.
1.	The following is said about the sin of Sodom.
a.	It is a sin that made men very wicked and sinful.
“But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly” (Ge. 13:13).
b.	It is forbidden by law.
“There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel” (De. 23:17).
c.	It was a sin committed by some in Israel.
“And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the Lord cast out before the children of Israel” (1 K. 14:24).
d.	It was one of the enslaving sins of the ancient world, a sin that led to “all forms of unrighteousness.”
“For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.… Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them” (Ro. 1:26–27, 32).
e.	It was a sin that debased and cheapened religion.
“And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove” (2 K. 23:7).
2.	The following is said about the judgment of Sodom and of sodomites, homosexuals.
a.	The land was judged, purified of the sin.
“And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made” (1 K. 15:12).
“And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land” (1 K. 22:46).
b.	The worship center (house of the Lord) was purified of the sin.
“And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove” (2 K. 23:7).
c.	The judgment of Sodom is a picture of the future judgment—the judgment yet to come.
“Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city” (Mt. 10:15).
“But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed [them] all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed” (Lu. 17:29–30).
“And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly” (2 Pe. 2:6).
“Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire” (Jude 7).
3.	The Lord Himself, however, gave great hope to the sodomites, the homosexuals of this earth. He said …
•	that Sodom was judged and destroyed because of sin, but that it would not have been destroyed if its people had repented
•	that Sodom and its people would answer for much in the day of judgment, but not for having neglected and rejected Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Note: how much more judgment will fall upon sodomites (homosexuals) who are guilty of both sodomy (homosexuality) and of rejecting Christ
But there is hope for every Sodomite: he or she can repent—turn away from their sin—and trust Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord.
“And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day” (Mt. 11:23).
“Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost” (Acts 2:38).
“Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord” (Acts 3:19).
“Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee” (Acts 8:22).
“Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon” (Is 55:7).
“But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die” (Eze. 18:21). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 102–103). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.



3 (19:12–14) Testimony, Weak—Lot, Life of: the third picture of backsliding is Lot’s powerless testimony and life. Lot was warned by the angels to save his family, for the city was to be destroyed because of its wickedness. Lot warned his family, but note what happened: they ridiculed and mocked him.
⇒	His message of judgment was not believed.
⇒	His own personal testimony was meaningless: he had lived a carnal, worldly life too long before his family. There was no difference between his life and the lives of the worldly. He had failed to point his family—his children—to God.
Thought 1. We must not fail to lead our children to Christ nor fail to teach them the ways of the Lord.
(1)	Lot failed—miserably failed—to obey God’s instructions in rearing his children.
“And thou shalt teach them [God’s commandments] diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up” (De. 6:7). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 103). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

4 (19:15–22) Worldliness: the fourth picture of backsliding is Lot’s desire to linger in the world. This is a descriptive picture of how far a believer can backslide. A believer can actually fall in love with the world despite the severe warnings of imminent judgment.
a. There was the urgent warning (v. 15). The two angels warned Lot: he needed to hurry, take his wife and two daughters and get out; flee the city lest they all be consumed.
b. Lot lingered (v. 16). The very thought of leaving home, business, and possessions—his attachment to the world and the things of the world—made it very difficult for him to leave. But God had mercy upon him: the two angels grabbed the hands of Lot, his wife, and daughters leading them out of the city.
c. There was an incredible spiritual weakness (vv. 17–20). What happened now was almost unbelievable, that a believer could slip back so far that he would crave the world …
•	despite his having just been saved from a catastrophic death by the glorious mercy of God
•	despite his facing impending judgment
When the angels led Lot and his family outside the city, the angels warned Lot again and urged him to escape for his life, to flee to the mountains out of the plain lest he be consumed (v. 17). But Lot pleaded against God’s will (v. 18):
⇒	Lot claimed to be physically incapable of reaching the mountain, that he might not be able to climb it in time to escape the destruction (v. 19). But this was a camouflage, self-deception for a worldly heart. God was saving him from the coming judgment, and God would have strengthened him for the journey to the mountain. Lot knew this.
⇒	Lot pleaded for the right to escape to a city nearby, to Zoar (v. 20). Tragic, pitiful, sorry—how sorry a person Lot had become, begging to stay close to Sodom, to the comforts of the world he had known. Remember, Lot was a wealthy businessman with large herds and holdings. Perhaps he thought his herds might be spared (after all, they were outside the city) if he could get God to spare Zoar and let him live there. Whatever the case, Lot was still trying to hold on to the world, to its possessions and comforts, to hold on even after God had just done so much for him. And Lot was very aware of the mercy God was showing him. He clearly said so (v. 19).
d. God now accepted Lot’s choice: he was allowed to live in Zoar and to continue living a worldly, carnal life (vv. 21–22). God pleaded no more; He gave Lot up to his life of carnality and worldliness. But God went ahead and saved Lot, saved him because of Abraham’s prayer. (See note—Ge. 18:22–26.)
“The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself” (Pr. 14:14). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 103–104). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


Deeper Study # 2
(19:21–22) Zoar: the name of the city means little. Zoar was a small Canaanite city that had been founded close to Sodom and Gomorrah.
⇒	Zoar was one of the cities attacked and defeated by an invading army from the East, but its citizens were saved by Abraham (Ge. 14:2, 8).
⇒	Zoar was one of the cities God had appointed to be destroyed along with Sodom and Gomorrah. However, it was saved in answer to Lot’s prayer (Ge. 19:22).
⇒	Zoar was a part of the promised land (De. 34:3).
⇒	Zoar was a city to which fugitives fled (Is. 15:5).
⇒	Zoar is to be judged and know the wrath of God (Je. 48:34). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 104). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.



5 (19:23–26) Judgment—Sodom—Gomorrah: the fifth picture of backsliding is Lot’s warning of judgment, a lesson for all of us.
a. The compromising believer lost everything (v. 23). Lot lost his home, his possessions, and all his wealth; but most tragic of all, he lost all of his family except two unmarried daughters. He had trusted the world, and now his world was gone.
b. The depraved unbelievers were judged; they suffered the condemnation of fire and brimstone (sulphur) (v. 24). Note these facts:
1)	Four cities were actually destroyed, all the cities of the area: Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim. Only Zoar was spared because of Lot (De. 29:23, see Ho. 11:8).
2)	The Lord Himself rained the fire and brimstone or sulphur down upon the cities. That is, God caused the judgment. The fire and brimstone are said twice to have come from the Lord (v. 24).
H.C. Leupold says this:
The “fire” which rained down from heaven may have been lightning. The “sulphur” may have been miraculously wrought and so have rained down together with the lightnings, although there is the other possibility that a huge explosion of highly inflammable materials, including sulphur, deposited in the ground (cf. the “bitumen pits” of 14:10) may have cast these materials, especially the sulphur, high into the air so that they rained upon these cities, causing a vast conflagration.
Henry Morris says this:
It seems possible, therefore, that God triggered an earthquake along the great fault at this time, which released and exposed to the atmosphere vast quantities of combustible hydrocarbons and sulphur. At the same time, God sent “fire from heaven,” which ignited the mixture in a great explosion and devastating fire. To Abraham, watching afar off with great concern ever since his intercessory prayer before the Lord, it seemed as though “the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.”
The “fire and brimstone” that fell from heaven possibly refers to the burning gas and sulphur that were blown into the air in the explosion and then fell back to the earth throughout the region. The most likely naturalistic explanation for the ignition of these materials probably would be that of a simultaneous electrical storm, in which case the lightning itself could also be described as “fire from heaven.” Similar terminology is used in Job 1:16; Ezekiel 38:22, and elsewhere, for what probably are also violent atmospheric phenomena.
Since natural physical phenomena, divinely timed, do seem adequate to explain the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, perhaps we should interpret the story in this way. We do not want to exclude the possibility, however, that a specially created divine fire was sent supernaturally from heaven to ignite the region. The Bible does record other such things, as in the days of Gideon (Judges 6:21), Elijah (1 Kings 18:38), and others. It is interesting that the word for “brimstone” in the New Testament is the Greek theion, meaning literally “God’s fire.” The personal connection of God and the two angelic messengers with Sodom’s destruction in itself tends to suggest that the “rain of brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven” was actually supernatural. There is certainly no reason for us to question either God’s ability or the appropriateness of a true creative miracle in this situation.
3)	Note that the Lord “overthrew” the cities (v. 25). The idea of “overthrow” is that of people standing against God: standing up in His face, cursing Him, standing up against Him in all their immorality, lawlessness, and rebellion. Consequently, God had to overthrow them, cast them down in judgment.
Thought 1. How like the world today! Just think of the people within every city who stand against God and …
•	curse Him
•	rebel against Him
•	commit immorality
•	are lawless
The day is coming when God has to overthrow the cities of the earth, when He has to cast them down in judgment. God is going to judge every one of us.
“When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: and before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his] sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.… Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels” (Mt. 25:31–34, 41). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 104–105). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

6 (19:27–29) Prayer: the sixth picture of backsliding is Lot’s deliverance in answer to prayer. Lot and his two daughters were saved only because of Abraham’s prayer.
a. Note the prayer warrior’s urgent anticipation. Abraham arose early to see what had happened. What he saw, no doubt, struck him with the deepest sorrow and emotional strain. The whole plain was filled with a dense smoke soaring up into the sky, a smoke so dense that it seemed to be furiously flowing up from a huge burning furnace, a furnace so large that it seemed to cover the whole area.
b. God’s remembrance of Abraham’s prayer is recounted. Note that Lot was not saved for his own sake: he had not followed God nor been a witness for God. He had lived for this world, lived for the bright lights, pleasures, money, wealth, property, position, honor, and possessions of this world. He had lived a carnal, worldly, fleshly life. There was no reason for God to save and keep him upon this earth: he just was not a witness for God. In fact, he damaged and disgraced God’s name. He shamed God, discredited Him, and blemished the name of other believers, for he was living a hypocritical life. Lot was saved for one reason and for one reason only: Abraham, his uncle, had prayed for him; and God heard and answered his prayer (v. 29).
“The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much” (Js. 5:16). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 105). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


c. Lot’s wife—the spouse of the backslider—loved the world and suffered the judgment of God (v. 26). Note that Lot’s wife was “behind him.” The idea is that she hesitated and had fallen some distance back. Lot’s wife loved Sodom and the comfortable life she had been living. She was, no doubt, feeling the pain of leaving Sodom and having to give up …
•	the bright lights and social life of the city
•	her home and possessions
•	her friends and neighbors
She was, after all, one of the more prominent wives in the city, her husband being a city official, perhaps even the mayor. She was well known and liked, a member of all the major social clubs and functions of the city.
Perhaps she had lagged back because she questioned the warnings of judgment, longed to return, and debated whether to question Lot about returning. Whatever the reason, she had dropped back and was thinking about Sodom, her home and the comforts of the life she had been living. And then it happened: she looked back, and she immediately was turned into a pillar of salt (v. 26). What does this mean?
⇒	It could mean that God miraculously acted and judged Lot’s wife by turning her into a pillar of salt.
⇒	It could mean that one of the volcanic explosions threw a salt deposit up into the air and God caused it to fall upon Lot’s wife when she disobeyed.
⇒	It could mean that she failed to rush far enough to escape the onrushing lava from the volcanic eruptions. She was thus buried and petrified in the ash and other materials (salt materials).

7 (19:30–38) Backsliding, Results: the seventh picture of backsliding is Lot’s tragic end, the results of backsliding.
a. There was fear. Lot and his two daughters had gone to Zoar, but just how long they stayed there is not known. All we know is that while there, Lot began to fear. Fear what? Did he fear the citizens of Zoar? Did they look with suspicion upon Lot and resent him, wondering if he was somehow to be blamed for the destruction of Sodom and the other cities? This is a possible explanation, but the context seems to indicate that he feared more judgment from God, that Zoar might also be destroyed by God. Zoar sat right in the middle of the destruction: Sodom and Gomorrah sat north and the other two cities sat south of Zoar. Consequently, mass destruction surrounded Zoar. It had been a flourishing city, but now the fertile land and the cities that had surrounded it and provided commerce were destroyed. Zoar’s wealth and markets were gone, the economy bankrupt. It was no longer a desirable place to live. Lot, in seeing all the surrounding destruction and knowing that Zoar sat right in the middle of the devastation, probably remembered that God had spared Zoar only because of him. God had originally planned to judge and destroy Zoar as well. Thus Lot began to fear the judgment of God upon Zoar so he fled the city. Sin had brought judgment upon Sodom, and Lot’s backsliding and worldly life had caused him to lose everything he had including his family. Now his backsliding caused even more suffering, the suffering of fear—the fear of more judgment from God.
Thought 1. Backsliding always brings the judgment of God upon a person; consequently, a backsliding believer needs to fear, fear enough to repent and turn back to God.
b. There was humiliation. Imagine having to live in a cave after being a city official or mayor of one of the leading cities of the world. That was Lot. He had lost everything, including his self-esteem and the respect of others. He was a devastated man: brought low, cast down, crushed, utterly humiliated, shamed, disgraced, and probably confused, confounded, and full of guilt. Lot had fallen to the bottom of the scale of human existence.
Thought 1. Worldliness—backsliding—will defeat any believer and eventually humiliate him.
c. There was a bad influence upon children (vv. 31–36). This is a sordid, shameful scene. But it shows the most tragic result of a backslidden life, the awful effect backsliding has upon children. Lot’s two daughters, living in the cave out in the middle of the mountains, began to worry if they would ever marry and bear children. Thus they plotted the most immoral scheme imaginable: to get their father drunk, have sex with him, and bear children. Note that the older sister carried out the scheme first (v. 33) and then influenced her younger sister to do the same (vv. 34–35). Immoral thoughts and plans, drunkenness and sexual impurity (incest), children misleading children into sin and shame—all due to the fact that Lot had lived a worldly and backslidden life before his daughters. True, they were virgins until this event: he had given them some moral training (see v. 8). But he had reared them in a worldly and wicked environment, in the social atmosphere of a city official that, no doubt, included drunkenness, dancing, and other activities that led to loose behavior. Lot himself apparently had loose morals, for there was only one place the daughters could have gotten the wine to make their father drunk: from him. He must have brought the wine out of Sodom when he fled the city. Imagine! Fleeing for your life and being able to save only what you can carry on your back and choosing wine to be one of the few items you save. Lot’s backslidden state was severe indeed. The example he had set before his family through the years was a sorry, pathetic example. No wonder these two young women went astray: all they had ever seen, despite some moral teaching, was an environment that allowed loose living that was socially acceptable to the higher society of business and government leaders.
“Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it” (Pr. 22:6).
“And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord” (Ep. 6:4).
d. There was trouble for future generations (vv. 37–38). The two daughters gave birth …
•	the older to a son named Moab, who became the father of the Moabite people
•	the younger to a son named Ben-ammi, who became the father of the Ammonite people
Both of these nations were to become bitter enemies and oppose Israel (the followers of God) in future generations. They eventually—down through the ages—intermixed with the Arabs as did many of the peoples throughout the Middle East region.
“Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, unto the third and to the fourth generation” (Ex. 34:7).
“Thou showest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, the Lord of hosts, is his name” (Je. 32:18).

Deeper Study # 3
(19:30–38) Lot—Backsliding: note these facts about Lot’s journey of backsliding.

HOMOSEXUAL — a person who is attracted sexually to members of his or her own sex. Homosexual behavior is prohibited in Scripture (Lev. 20:13) and was a major cause of the divine judgment against Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:4–5, 12–13). The apostle Paul listed homosexuals among “the unrighteous” who would not inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9), and declared that God’s wrath stands against such behavior, whether practiced by men or women (Rom. 1:26–27).

20 But that is not the way you learned Christ!— 21 assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus, 22 to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, 23 and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, 24 and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.

            <Text>Warning Against Worldliness
4 What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? 2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. 3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. 4 You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. 5 Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”? 6 But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” 7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 8 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 9 Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Jas 4:1–10). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.

But “fightings” and “wars” are already in evidence among them; and, if covetous zeal goes unrestrained, the danger of actual violence is real. With penetrating insight, then, James provides us with a powerful analysis of human conflict. Verbal argument, private violence, or national conflict—the cause of them all can be traced back to the wrongful lust to want more than we have, to be envious of and covet what others have, whether it be their position or their possessions.

The life of a follower of Jesus, then, is not to be led in fear of judgment but in hope of a new age. Fear tends to paralyze people rather than to motivate them. Thus, while our author goes to pains to refute the teachings of the “scoffers,” his focus is on the new that is coming rather than on the fearfulness of the intermediate judgment. His addressees are to be living the life of the future age no matter how dysfunctional it may seem in this age, for the structures of this age are temporary—we will likely be surprised at how quickly they collapse—and the structures of the coming age are permanent. Given the massive investment of contemporary Christians in the nationalism, materialism, and pleasure orientation of Western culture, this passage should serve as wake-up call.

            <Title>The Shame of Lot</Title>
            <Text>After God’s destruction of the cities of the Plain, Lot and his two daughters leave Zoar to live in the hills. Lot has hit rock bottom and lost everything, including his wife. Concerned about their lack of marital prospects and wanting to produce offspring, his daughters conspire to incestuously have heirs by Lot (Genesis 19:31-32). This plan, borne out of fear and not faith in God, speaks volumes about their value system. On two separate occasions the daughters made Lot drunk, slept with him and consequently gave birth to two sons who will be the fathers of the Moabites and Ammonites (Genesis 19:32-38). Ironically, these two people groups will be bitter foes of Abraham’s elect descendants (Israel) and thus rejected by God (Deuteronomy 23:3-6). Yet, the lineage of Moab will produce Ruth, who because of her faith will be included among the tribe of Judah and become an ancestor of Jesus Christ (Ruth 4:18-22; Matthew 1:5). </Text>

            <Text>O.	Abraham Saw the Promised Son Isaac Born: Rewarded Faith—How God Fulfills His Promises, 21:1–7
(21:1–7) Introduction: at last the great day came: the promised son was born. The hope and longing were finally realized. It had been twenty-five years since God had given Abraham the promise of a son, twenty-five long years. Now, the waiting was over. Sarah bore Abraham a son, the promised son, the son from whom kings and nations were to be born and from whom the Savior of the world was to come. God always fulfills His promises. He fulfilled His promise to Abraham, and He will fulfill His promises to us. This is the subject of this great chapter: Abraham Saw the Promised Son Isaac Born: Rewarded Faith—How God Fulfills His Promises, 21:1–7.
1.	To prove Himself, His Word and power: He has the power to do exactly as He has promised (vv. 1–2).
2.	To stir obedience and faithfulness to God (vv. 3–5).
3.	To stir joy and rejoicing over God’s power (vv. 6–7). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 115). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


1 (21:1–2) Word of God—Promises Of God—Isaac: How does God fulfill His promises? He proves Himself, His Word and power. God uses His power to do exactly as He has promised. God kept His Word. Note how the Word of God is stressed. God had promised a son to Abraham and Sarah, and He gave them a son. He did exactly what He had promised He would do.
Note another fact as well: the son was born in Abraham’s “old age,” at the very time appointed or set by God. The birth was a miracle. Abraham and Sarah were both too old to bear children. They were well beyond childbearing years, but God miraculously quickened—made alive, rejuvenated—their bodies so that they could bear a child. In fact, the very time for the birth was set by God, and the son was born at the very time God had appointed. The birth was controlled by God from start to finish, controlled by His power. God had the power to prove Himself, to fulfill His promise, His Word, to do exactly as He had promised.
Thought 1. God keeps His Word, His promises, but God sometimes delays His promises just as He did with Abraham. We often need to grow in our faith …
•	to learn more endurance and hardness
•	to become stronger and more determined
•	to learn to trust and hope more in God
•	to pray and fellowship more with God
There are a multitude of reasons why God may not immediately fulfill His promises in our lives. But two facts are always true:
(1)	God is faithful to His promises. God will always do exactly what He promises He will do. He may delay for a while in order to strengthen us or to teach us some lesson. But God is faithful; He will prove Himself and fulfill His promises to us.
“God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord” (1 Co. 1:9).
“But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil” (2 Th. 3:3).
“If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself” (2 Ti. 2:13).
“Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; for he is faithful that promised” (He. 10:23).
(2)	God is powerful enough to keep His promises. He has the power to do exactly what He says He will do, the power to fulfill His promises in our lives.
“But Jesus beheld [them], and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible” (Mt. 19:26).
“For with God nothing shall be impossible” (Lu. 1:37).
“Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began” (Ro. 16:25).
“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us” (Ep. 3:20).
“Is any thing too hard for the Lord?” (Ge. 18:14).
“I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee” (Jb. 42:2).
Thought 2. Abraham and Sarah had to wait twenty-five years to receive the promise of God. Imagine! Twenty-five years. How impatient we so often become before God.
“That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises” (He. 6:12).
“And so, after he [Abraham] had patiently endured, he obtained the promise” (He. 6:15).
“For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise” (He. 10:36). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 115–116). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


2 (21:3–5) Obedience—Isaac—Circumcision: How does God fulfill His promises? He stirs obedience and faithfulness to God. Abraham’s joy can just be imagined. Remember: when God first told Abraham that the time had finally come, the son was now to be born, Abraham fell on his face in worship (Ge. 17:17). He was so full of joy that he burst forth in laughter, a laughter of faith. God was so pleased with this experience of worship and joy that He instructed Abraham to memorialize the event forever in the name of the child. The name Isaac means “he laughs,” “he joys.” The long wait for a son—twenty-five years—was over. The son was born. Abraham’s joy must have broken loose in a praise and worship of God beyond expression. But note: it is not Abraham’s joy that is stressed in these verses; in fact, his joy is not even mentioned. What is the focus? Abraham’s obedience to God. This is very significant, for God would not have fulfilled His promise to Abraham if Abraham had not been an obedient follower of God. Abraham obeyed God all throughout his life, not perfectly, but consistently and diligently. Therefore, God was able to fulfill His promises in the life of Abraham. Note how clearly Abraham’s obedience is pictured, even at the birth of his son.
⇒	He named his son Isaac. This was in obedience to God. God had long before told Abraham to name his son Isaac (Ge. 17:19).
⇒	He circumcised Isaac when the baby was eight days old. This, too, was in obedience to God. God had instituted the ritual of circumcision with Abraham some years before (Ge. 17:10–14).
Note another fact that is stressed: the miracle of the birth (v. 5). Abraham recognized his dependence upon God: the birth was a miracle. He was 100 years old, well beyond childbearing years. The son was not due to him but to God. God and God alone had given him a son. He was totally dependent upon God, and he owed this blessing—the blessing of his son—to God and God alone.
Thought 1. We must obey God in order to receive the promises of God. This does not mean that we must be perfect before God can pour out His promises upon us. But it does mean that we have to do what Abraham did: believe God and diligently seek to follow God. It means that we set our hearts upon God, that we seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, that we diligently seek to obey God.
“But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you” (Mt. 6:33).
“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven” (Mt. 7:21). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 116). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 2. God fulfills His promises, always fulfills them.
(1)	God’s promises never fail.
“Blessed be the Lord, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant” (1 K. 8:56).
(2)	God’s promises are guaranteed because of His omnipotent, unlimited power.
“He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; and being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform” (Ro. 4:20–21).
“Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us” (Ep. 3:20).
“For with God nothing shall be impossible” (Lu. 1:37).
“Is any thing too hard for the Lord?” (Ge. 18:14).
(3)	God’s promises are great and precious.
“Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust” (2 Pe. 1:4).
(4)	God’s promises have one great purpose: to give us eternal life.
“And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life” (1 Jn. 2:25).
(5)	God’s promises are based upon faith.
“Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things [are] possible to him that believeth” (Mk. 9:23).
“And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you” (Lu. 17:6).

P.	Abraham Sent Away Hagar and Ishmael, the Slavewoman and Her Son: Conquering Faith—Confronting and Overcoming Conflict, 21:8–21
(21:8–21) Introduction: conflict is always destructive and painful. Conflict destroys peace and security, the peace and security …
•	of hearts
•	of communities
•	of families
•	of schools
•	of work
•	of nations
Conflict is painful: it hurts, sometimes mildly, sometimes dangerously. Conflict can range from bumping heads over some issue to conflict and war. It can range from a small disagreement over to locking horns and being divorced from one another. Conflict can arouse a small sense of uneasiness within us or it can rip us apart.
But note this: we can use conflict to arouse us and stir us to move on and achieve more, or we can allow conflict to destroy us. This is what this passage is all about: confronting and conquering conflict. This is a most interesting story: Abraham Sent Away Hagar and Ishmael, the Slavewoman and Her Son: Conquering Faith—Confronting and Conquering Conflict, 21:8–21.
1.	The nature of the conflict: much attention was being showered on Isaac (vv. 8–11).
2.	The answer to the conflict: God (vv. 12–13).
3.	The results of the conflict (vv. 14–16b).
4.	The conquest and triumph over the conflict (vv. 16c–21).
Please note: this conflict between Ishmael and Isaac and between their mothers, Hagar and Sarah, is used as an illustration in the New Testament. (See outline and notes—Ga. 4:21–31 for discussion.) The conflict pictures the conflict of …
⇒	bondage vs. freedom
⇒	flesh vs. spirit
⇒	law vs. grace
⇒	old religion vs. new religion
⇒	present day Jerusalem vs. the New Jerusalem, the capital of the new heavens and earth
⇒	earthly, fleshly inheritance vs. Godly, eternal inheritance Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 120–121). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


1 (21:8–11) Conflict, Cause—Strife—Ishmael—Sarah—Isaac—Feast, Weaning: there was the cause of the conflict. Very simply, sin caused the conflict within Abraham’s family, and sin is usually the cause of conflict among most of us. What happened in Abraham’s family was this: Abraham threw a great feast for Isaac when he was weaned from his mother’s breast. Note the word great: it was a great feast. This was apparently a Near East custom of that day when a child reached 2–3 years old. At some point during the feast, Sarah saw Ishmael mocking Isaac: ridiculing, poking fun, being mean-spirited and bitter toward him. Remember, Isaac was just a baby, two or three years old, and Ishmael was sixteen or seventeen years old (see Ge. 16:16; 21:5). Just imagine a young man that old mocking and ridiculing a baby. Moreover, note the word mocking (metsachcheq). The Hebrew has the idea of “always mocking.” Ishmael always displayed bitterness and anger toward Isaac; he was always mocking and being mean-spirited to the baby. Why? What would cause Ishmael to be so mean to Isaac? Because Abraham was always heaping attention upon Isaac, the attention that Ishmael had once received before Isaac’s birth. Abraham’s attention was now split two ways, and he was more focused upon the baby, Isaac, than upon Ishmael. Ishmael should have understood: he was old enough to know that the baby was bound to become the focus of attention. He was old enough to understand …
•	that the baby needed more attention
•	that the baby was bound to be a special joy to Abraham because he was born in Abraham’s old age
•	that the baby was the promised child, miraculously given by God
But Ishmael refused to accept the baby’s presence within the family, refused to accept Isaac as the promised child. He continuously mocked, adopting a mean-spirited attitude toward the child who was appointed by God to be the promised son. And Sarah saw the mockery time and again. Apparently, the ridicule reached a peak at the great feast celebrating Isaac’s weaning, and Sarah witnessed the ugly scene. It was all she could take, enough was enough, and she boiled over. She demanded that Abraham send away (cast out, drive out, get rid of) the slavewoman and her son, Ishmael.

Ishmael had sinned through his mockery and jealousy and his failure to trust the will and care of God. Now Sarah was sinning by over-reacting. She was demanding a cruel solution to the conflict. She took matters into her own hands instead of seeking God for an answer to the conflict. She was overtaken by a spirit of distrust toward God and of cruelty toward Ishmael and his mother, Hagar. Remember, Hagar had been Sarah’s personal servant for decades. But Sarah was apparently so overtaken with anger that she just ignored God and reacted against Ishmael and Hagar. The effect upon Abraham was devastating, for he loved Ishmael, loved him with all his heart. Abraham was stricken with a heavy heart; he was distressed, not knowing what to do.
Thought 1. Note two facts about conflict and strife:
(1)	Conflict is very dangerous. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 121). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
2 (21:12–13) Conflict, Answer to: there was the answer to the conflict. The answer was God. Being forced to send a child away is almost more than any loving parent can bear. Sarah’s demand to get rid of Ishmael was a heavy pressure upon Abraham. But God knew. He knew all about Abraham’s heavy heart and distress, all about his perplexity, just not knowing what to do. No doubt, Abraham prayed and discussed the matter with God, and God heard and cared about Abraham’s need. Therefore, God set about to meet Abraham’s need.
a. First, God gave Abraham His Word. God spoke to Abraham, encouraging him and relieving the distress and grief. Note when God spoke to Abraham: at night (v. 14). Apparently, Abraham was doing what we all do when we are under heavy distress: pray. He was either lying in bed or up during the night, praying and thinking the conflict through. And God met him: the Word of God came to Abraham and met his need.
As for Sarah, she was right. Ishmael needed to be sent away, for his mocking and ridicule was too imbedded in him to change. The conflict would only grow worse. But Sarah’s attitude of cruelty toward Ishmael was wrong, and her failure to seek and trust God for an answer was wrong. She had broken Abraham’s heart and caused heavy distress and grief for him.
But as noted, God spoke to Abraham, and God’s Word always meets the need of the human heart. God’s Word always relieves our distress and grief, relieves whatever conflict wages within our souls. God’s Word always encourages us: it encouraged Abraham and it encourages us.
b. Second, God reminded Abraham of His great purpose: Isaac was to be the promised son, the son who was to give rise to the chosen line, the offspring of God. Remember, this refers both to the people of God, those who truly believe and follow after God, and to the promised Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. Ishmael was not the line chosen to bring God’s Seed, the Savior, into the world; Isaac was (see Ga. 3:16).
c. Third, God assured Abraham that the conflict would be resolved. Ishmael would be looked after and richly blessed by God. He would grow into a great nation of people. God would see to it. Note why: not for Ishmael’s sake but for Abraham’s sake. Ishmael’s egotistical, superior attitude over Isaac had apparently become imbedded and extremely sinful. Consequently, God could not act for Ishmael’s sake; God could not sanction Ishmael’s sinful ways by acting in his behalf. But Abraham was a different matter. Abraham loved and followed God; therefore, for Abraham’s sake, God would bless Abraham’s son Ishmael.
The point is this: God knew all about the conflict, all of Abraham’s distress and perplexity, that he did not know what to do, that he did not know how to handle the conflict. Therefore, God met Abraham. Most likely, Abraham was in prayer, crying out for God to help him. And God did.
⇒	God gave Abraham His Word: spoke to Abraham, relieving his distress and telling him what to do (v. 12).
⇒	God reminded Abraham of God’s great purpose (v. 12).
⇒	God assured Abraham that the conflict would be resolved: God would take care of Ishmael and bless him (v. 13).
Thought 1. God’s answer to conflict is the same for every generation, for every one of us. No matter what the conflict is …
•	the answer is found in God’s Word. His Word will relieve whatever distress we have and give us the answer to our questions. God’s Word tells us what to do. Our task is to search His Word for the peace we need and for the answers to our questions
•	the answer is found in God’s purpose. We must remind ourselves of God’s purpose both for His people and for the world
•	the answer is found in God’s assurance of blessing. No matter what the solution to the conflict may be, God will take care of us and our needs—if we will trust and believe God, just as Abraham did Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 121–122). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

3 (21:14–16b) Conflict, Results: there were the results of the conflict. The results were devastating.
a. There were the broken hearts, the separation, and divorce (v. 14). The conflict was deeply imbedded within Ishmael’s heart, apparently so imbedded that he would never change. God knew this, so the only way the conflict could ever be resolved was for Ishmael and Hagar, his mother, to be sent away.
Just picture the scene as Abraham arose early in the morning, taking bread and water to Hagar. There was bound to be tenderness, warmth, love, and brokenness as Abraham set the two leather straps over the shoulders of Hagar and Ishmael and sent them away. The piercing pain and hurt must have been almost unbearable.
Thought 1. The results of conflict are often devastating. Many have had their hearts broken because of conflict, conflict that led to …
•	separation
•	divorce
•	the loss of a loved one
b. There was the wandering about, being lost, not knowing where to go nor what to do next (v. 14b). Scripture does not say where Hagar was heading, but she was probably traveling back home to Egypt (Ge. 16:1). For some reason, she lost her way and began to wander all about. She was at a loss, not knowing where to go or what to do next, all because of the conflict.
Thought 1. Note how Hagar’s experience pictures the experience of so many persons. So many are wandering about in the world, lost, not knowing where to go or what to do next—all because some conflict led to …
•	separation
•	divorce
•	the loss of a loved one
So many persons are lost out in the desert of the world, all alone or else with no one but a child. Just think of the single mothers and fathers, the heavy pressure of raising children all alone. The loneliness and desperation of the situation are often almost unbearable.
c. There was the exhaustion, hopelessness, and threat of death (vv. 15–16). Hagar and Ishmael used up all their provisions. There was no more bread and not even any more water left. They were so exhausted that they could go no farther. Note that Ishmael, the sixteen or seventeen year old young man, had apparently fainted from thirst and exhaustion. Hagar pulled him over under a bush and went off and sat down about a bow shot away. There was no more hope: the situation was now beyond repair; Hagar could do no more. She just could not bear watching him die.
Thought 1. Think of the people all over the world who …
•	are totally exhausted
•	have no food or water
•	are hopeless
•	face the threat of death
Why? All because of conflict, the conflict that led to separation, divorce, war, or some other devastating result. The results of conflict are destructive, unending in the toll they take upon human life. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 122–123). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

4 (21:16c–21) Conflict, Conquest of—Ishmael: there was the conquest or triumph over the conflict. Seven things now happened that clearly show us how to conquer and triumph over conflict.
a. Hagar wept bitterly and lifted up her voice in prayer. To lift up one’s voice suggests prayer. Hagar and Ishmael would soon die, all because of the conflict that raged within the soul of Ishmael. Hagar had reached the end of her strength, done all she could. She simply could do no more, not within her own strength. Sitting there, she wept bitterly and did the only thing she could do: lifted up her voice and cried out to God in prayer.
Thought 1. Too often, this is the position we have to be in before we will cry out to God: at the end of our rope, no strength, no way to do anything within ourselves.
Nevertheless, God loves us and cares for us. We must, therefore, cry out to God, whether early or late, whether facing mild or desperate need.
b. Hagar listened to the Word of God and thought over her problem (v. 17a). God heard Hagar’s prayer and spoke to her out of heaven. God gave Hagar His Word to meet her need. Note what God did:
⇒	He stirred her to think about her problem. “What is the problem, Hagar?”
Thought 1. We have the permanent Word of God. When we face problems and crises, we desperately need to go to God’s Word for guidance, crying out to Him for help and direction. Note also, we need to do what God was stirring Hagar to do: think through the problem facing us. If we sincerely seek God in prayer and in His Word, thinking through the problem to the best of our ability, God will help us. We will be able to conquer and triumph over all conflicts, problems, and crises.
c. Ishmael lifted up his voice and cried out to God, apparently asking for forgiveness (v. 17c). Again, lifting up one’s voice suggests prayer. Note, God said twice that He had heard the voice of Ishmael. Apparently Ishmael was also praying, weeping, and crying out to God. Most likely, he was asking God for forgiveness, knowing that it was his mocking and ridicule that had brought him and his mother to the point of death.
Thought 1. God stresses the fact that He heard the voice (Hebrew) of Ishmael. God says this two times. This points out the utter necessity of repentance, of crying out for God to forgive our sins when we have done wrong. Then and only then does God hear us. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).

            <Text>Sermon Theme and Goal
We formulated the textual theme as, “Rejoice in the Lord’s faithfulness in fulfilling his promise by miraculously calling Isaac/Israel into existence.” The context of the Old and New Testaments shows that the promise of a child and ultimately “a multitude of nations” (17:5, 16) finds further fulfillment in the birth of Jacob, in the birth of the nation of Israel, finally in Israel’s Messiah, Jesus Christ, who sends his disciples out to “make disciples of all nations” (Matt 28:19) and, ultimately, in Jesus’ second coming when “the nations will walk” by God’s light (Rev 21:23–24). In order to encompass this context as well as the original message, we can formulate the sermon theme as, Rejoice in the Lord’s faithfulness in fulfilling his promise by miraculously calling his people (Isaac/Israel/the church) into existence.
The narrator’s goal we formulated as, “to encourage Israel to rejoice in the Lord’s faithfulness which miraculously called them into existence as the Lord’s special people.” Similarly, our goal in preaching this narrative can be, to encourage the church to rejoice in the Lord’s faithfulness which miraculously called them into existence as the Lord’s special people. This particular goal implies that the need addressed in this sermon is our lack of reflection on and joy in the miracle of the church and our membership in it. Greidanus, S. (2007).

Scripture Readings
Since this narrative from promise to initial fulfillment covers ten chapters, one of the challenges is to select an appropriate number of passages for Scripture reading. I suggest that one read passages about God’s promises to Abraham and Sarah before the sermon but save the passage on the fulfillment, Genesis 21:1–7, for the sermon itself. This will enhance the possibility of capturing in the sermon some of the tension of this lengthy narrative. For example, before preaching the sermon one can read Genesis 11:27–30; 12:1–4a; and 15:1–6, and ask the people to keep their Bibles open at Genesis. In the sermon itself briefly explain these passages of God’s promise of a child, even many descendants, and then continue quoting and explaining Genesis 16:1–4a; 17:15–19; 18:9–15; and perhaps 20:2, building up the tension until the resolution in Genesis 21:1–7.

Sermon Exposition
Given the sermon goal and need, the introduction can illustrate that many people take membership in the church of Jesus Christ for granted or even consider it a burden. 

Israel, too, frequently failed to appreciate the miracle of belonging to God’s covenant people. And yet the existence of Israel was a miracle of God. Abram was seventy-five years old when God promised to bless him and make of him a great nation (12:2). But the narrator has just informed us that Abram’s wife Sarai “was barren; she had no child” (11:30). How can God make a great nation of Abram when his wife is infertile?

After many years of waiting, Abram complained to God. We read in Genesis 15:2–5, “Abram said, ‘O Lord God, what will you give me, for I continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?’ And Abram said, ‘You have given me no offspring [seed], and so a slave born in my house is to be my heir.’ But the word of the Lord came to him, ‘This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue shall be your heir.’ He brought him outside and said, ‘Look toward heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them.’ Then he said to him, ‘So shall your descendants be.’ ” Three times now the Lord has repeated his promise to Abram on ever grander scale: in Genesis 12:2, “I will make of you a great nation”; in Genesis 13:16, “I will make your offspring [seed] like the dust of the earth”; in Genesis 15:5, Your descendants will be like the stars in the sky. Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 187–188). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

Still Abram and Sarai received no children. And it is becoming more and more unlikely that they will get children. Abram is now eighty-five years old and Sarai seventy-five. So Sarai comes up with an alternative plan. The Lord had promised Abram many descendants, but he had never said explicitly that this would be with his wife Sarai. In that culture, if a wife was unable to have children, the custom was for the husband to produce children with his wife’s slave-girl. In chapter 16:2 we read that Sarai says to Abram, “You see that the Lord has prevented me from bearing children; go into my slave-girl; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.” This must have been an incredibly difficult step for Sarai, but it seemed that this was the only way for her to get children. And Abram agreed. So Sarai gave Hagar, her slave-girl, to Abram “as a wife” (16:3). The plan worked: Hagar became pregnant, and, as we read in verse 15, “Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram named his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.” The narrator adds, “Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.” Just in the nick of time did they resort to this plan. Abram had a son in his old age. The tension in the narrative is resolved. The Lord had fulfilled his promise.

For thirteen years Abram and Sarai seem to have accepted the idea that Ishmael was the promised son. Abram, at least, seems to have been content with that thought (see 17:18). But then the suspense starts all over again. We read in chapter 17:1, “When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him.” On this occasion the Lord for the first time specifically includes Sarai in his promise of children. God changes Sarai’s name to Sarah and says to Abraham, verse 16, “I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her.” Abraham cannot believe his ears. A son by Sarah who now is ninety years old? And he almost a hundred! We read in verse 17, “Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said to himself, ‘Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?’ ” It is the laughter of disbelief! It is now impossible for Abraham and Sarah to have children of their own. Abraham pleads with God (v. 18), “O that Ishmael might live in your sight!” But God replies, “No, but your wife Sarah shall bear you a son, and you shall name him Isaac.” The name Isaac means “he laughs.” The very name of the promised son will remind Abraham and later Israel that Abraham laughed in disbelief of God’s promise. It is simply impossible for a hundred-year-old man and his barren, ninety-year-old wife to conceive and have a child. Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 188–189). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

In chapter 18 the Lord appears to Abraham again and repeats the promise. Verse 10, “I will surely return to you in due season, and your wife Sarah shall have a son.” Sarah is in the tent and overhears this comment. It seems that this is the first time she hears about receiving her own son, for we read in verse 12, “So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, ‘After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?’ ” Sarah’s language is quite crude: she describes herself literally as being “worn out” (TNIV), like clothing ready to be discarded (cf. Josh 9:13), and as incapable of sensual pleasure. The Lord asks Abraham in verse 13, “Why did Sarah laugh, and say, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’ Is anything too wonderful for the Lord? At the set time I will return to you, in due season, and Sarah shall have a son.” But Sarah denies her disbelief. She says, “ ‘I did not laugh’; for she was afraid.” The Lord responds, “Oh yes, you did laugh.”

First Abraham laughed in disbelief, and now Sarah laughs in disbelief. Sarah laughs at the sheer impossibility of her having a child. The Lord responds to this laughter of disbelief with the question, “Is anything too wonderful for the Lord?” An important question that we will need to reflect on later. But here the narrator emphasizes Sarah’s laughter by repeating the word four times. First he tells us in verse 12 that “Sarah laughed.” Next the Lord asks (v. 13), “Why did Sarah laugh?” Then Sarah denies it, saying (v. 15), “I did not laugh”; to which the Lord responds, “Oh yes, you did laugh.” The point is that God causes this laughter of disbelief because his promise of a child to a couple “as good as dead” (Rom 4:19) is really incredible! Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (p. 189). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

The narrator leaves us hanging there with the laughter of disbelief ringing in our ears. He moves on to other stories: God’s intent to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah (18:16–33), the depravity of Sodom (19:1–11), the angels saving Lot and his daughters from the destruction of Sodom (19:12–29), and Lot’s incest with his daughters (19:30–38). The overarching narrative of Abraham and Sarah receiving the promised child is picked up again in chapter 20 and reaches a climax when Abraham in Gerar (near Gaza) again (see 12:13) passes off Sarah as his sister. So “King Abimelech of Gerar sent and took Sarah” (20:2). Abraham is risking the mother of the promised child in the harem of Abimelech. Kidner comments, “On the brink of Isaac’s birth-story here is the very Promise put in jeopardy, traded away for personal safety. If it is ever to be fulfilled, it will owe very little to man. Morally as well as physically, it will clearly have to be achieved by the grace of God.”6


Finally, in chapter 21 we read of God fulfilling his promise to Abraham and Sarah. Verse 1,
The Lord dealt with Sarah as he had said,
and the Lord did for Sarah as he had promised.
The NRSV translates the Hebrew word pāqad as, “The Lord dealt with Sarah,” while the TNIV translates, “Now the Lord was gracious to Sarah.” The same word is also used in Genesis 50:24–25 to describe God “coming to” Israel to bring them up out of Egypt to the Promised Land. So the Lord here “comes to” or “visits” Sarah to fulfill his promise: “as he had said, … as he had promised.” The birth of a son for Sarah was “predicted twice (17:16–21; 18:10–15), and here the fulfillment of the promises is mentioned twice.” Calvin observes that there is “great emphasis in the repetition.… For he thus retains his readers, as by laying his hand upon them, that they may pause in the consideration of so great a miracle.”9

Verse 2, “Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the time of which God had spoken to him.” This is the third time the narrator reminds us of God’s prior word: “as he [the Lord] had said,” “as he had promised,” “at the time of which God had spoken.’ ” Sailhamer comments, “The plan not only came about, but, more importantly, it happened as it was announced. Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 189–190). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

Thus the narrative calls attention to God’s faithfulness to his word and to his careful attention to the details of his plan.”

In verse 3 we read that “Abraham gave the name Isaac to his son whom Sarah bore him. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.” Significantly, Abraham does not get a line thanking God for Isaac, but, as before (12:4), he obeys God to the letter. God had said, “You shall name him Isaac” (17:19), and Abraham names his son Isaac. God had said, “Every male among you shall be circumcised when he is eight days old” (17:12), and Abraham circumcises Isaac “when he was eight days old.”

The Hebrew in verse 3 reads literally, “And Abraham called the name of his son which was born to him, whom Sarah had born to him, Isaac.” Wenham observes, “Comparison with 16:15 shows that ‘which was born to him’ is unnecessary. But the repetition again serves to drive home the miraculous nature of the birth of a son to Sarah.” And to Abraham, we might add. For the additional phrase results in the repetition of “born to him.” For good measure the narrator adds in verse 5, “Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.” Isaac is indeed a child who could only have been called into being by the miraculous power of the faithful Lord. Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (p. 191). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

Interestingly, whereas Abram does not get a single line in this passage, it concludes with a substantial song of praise by Sarah. Verse 6, “Now Sarah said, God has brought laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh with me.” God has turned the laughter of disbelief into the laughter of joy. Every time she will call Isaac, she will be reminded of her laughter of disbelief. The Lord had asked, “Is anything too wonderful for the Lord?” (18:14). Well, that depends on how great your God is. Now Sarah knows: nothing is too wonderful for the Lord! He who created the universe with his word is able to fulfill his promise, no matter how impossible it seems. Jesus also had to remind his disciples, “For God all things are possible” (Matt 19:26).

With the miraculous fulfillment of his promise, the Lord has turned Sarah’s laughter of disbelief into genuine laughter. Sarah says, “Everyone who hears will laugh with me.” Certainly her household will laugh with her, but also later Israel. For in a real sense Israel was born that day. Had Isaac not been born, there would have been no Israel. Israel owed its existence to the Lord’s faithfulness in miraculously calling Isaac into existence generations earlier. So when Israel heard this story, they were expected to laugh with Sarah, to rejoice in the Lord’s faithfulness which miraculously called them into existence. And also to rejoice in the Lord’s faithfulness which miraculously sustained them in their trials, even bringing a remnant back from exile. Psalm 126:1–2 reflects this joy which echoes Sarah’s laughter:
When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion,
we were like those who dream.
Then our mouth was filled with laughter,
and our tongue with shouts of joy;
then it was said among the nations,
“The Lord has done great things for them.” Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 191–192). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.


Like Israel, we also are expected to laugh with Sarah, to rejoice in the Lord’s faithfulness which miraculously, throughout the ages, calls his people into existence.

Sarah concludes her praise song with a rhetorical question in verse 7. She asks, “Who would ever have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.” Who would ever have said it? Not Abraham. Certainly not Sarah. No one would have said it, for it is impossible for a ninety-year-old woman to nurse children. Yet the Lord made the impossible possible. He fulfilled his promise: Isaac was born. The son of the covenant was born, the first of a long line of descendants. God’s covenant people began to multiply on earth. First it was one son, later a nation. And then Isaiah (9:6) would prophesy,
For a child has been born for us,
a son given to us;
authority rests upon his shoulders;
and he is named Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
Can God fulfill this promise of a divine son? “Is anything too wonderful for the Lord?”
Jesus’ birth of the virgin Mary was even more miraculous than Isaac’s birth of ninety-year-old Sarah. At Jesus’ birth, too, there was much laughter. Mary sang her song of praise even before Jesus’ birth (Luke 1:46–55).
“My soul magnifies the Lord,
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant.
Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;
for the Mighty One has done great things for me.…
He has helped his servant Israel,
in remembrance of his mercy,
according to the promise he made to our ancestors,
to Abraham and to his descendants forever.” Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 192–193). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

At Jesus’ birth the angels sang “Glory to God” and the shepherds rejoiced as well as Simeon, Anna, the wise men from the East, and many others. Yet this child was not named Isaac, laughter. God commanded Joseph, “You are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins” (Matt 1:21). The name “Jesus,” Yahweh saves, is even more cause for rejoicing than the name “Isaac.”
Jesus brought joy by preaching the good news of the kingdom of God, by healing people of their diseases, but especially by giving his life as a ransom for many. In a dispute with the Jews, Jesus said to them, “Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; he saw it and was glad” (John 8:56). Jesus was referring to Isaac’s birth and the laughter it brought about. How did Abraham see Jesus’ day in Isaac’s birth? Isaac’s birth was in fulfillment of God’s covenant promise to Abraham that he would have a child with Sarah. But God’s promise was for much more than a child; God promised to make Abraham the “father of a multitude of nations.” This promise was initially fulfilled in the birth of Isaac, but it reached for its fulfillment far beyond Isaac and the nation of Israel to Abraham’s son Jesus Christ, who would command his disciples to “make disciples of all nations” and poured out his Spirit to enable them to do so (see Acts 2). In the birth of Isaac, Abraham saw Jesus’ day, for he saw the initial fulfillment of God’s promise to make him the “father of a multitude of nations.” Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (p. 193). Grand Rapids, MI; Cambridge, U.K.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company.

When the New Testament church was born at Pentecost, some three thousand persons were baptized, joining the church of Jesus Christ, rejoicing and “praising God” (Acts 2:47). Later, when Paul and Barnabas preached in Antioch, they recalled their mission: “The Lord has commanded us, saying, ‘I have set you to be a light for the Gentiles, so that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’ ” Luke comments, “When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and praised the word of the Lord” (Acts 13:47–48). What an awesome work God has done in grafting Gentiles into the stem of Abraham, in miraculously calling into existence the church of Jesus Christ as his special people.

How thankful we should be that God gave “laughter” to Abraham and Sarah and that he gave great joy to the virgin Mary. How we should rejoice that “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life” (John 3:16). Abraham saw Jesus’ day and was glad; we have seen Jesus’ day and should be glad! Paul exhorts the church in Colossae, “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly …; and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him” (Col 3:16–17). Greidanus, S. (2007).

Theme. We have all experienced tests of our faith—situations that require us to trust that God will provide. In these times, the question becomes: How do we respond? Do we allow fear and doubt to control us, or do we trust God with an extreme faith?
Abraham experienced many tests of faith in his life. At times, he responded obediently and trusted in God’s promises. Other times, however, he responded out of fear or tried to take matters into his own hands. In Genesis 22, Abraham received one final extreme test of his faith—a test that came directly from God (Gen 22:1).
Literary Context. After years of uncertainty, the promised birth finally happened. Sarah welcomed a son, whom Abraham named Isaac (Gen 21:2–3). Abraham circumcised him when he was eight days old, just as God had commanded (Gen 21:4; see 17:12). The pieces of the promise finally fell into place: Abraham had the promised son through Sarah, just as God said. Emphasizing Sarah’s inability to bear children (Gen 17:17; 18:11–12) and Abraham’s old age, the Bible testifies that God truly worked a miracle.
The various mentions of Abraham’s age anchor the progression of events in real time and show the accuracy of God’s promise. When Abraham was 99 years old (Gen 17:1, 24), God twice stated that He would give Abraham and Sarah a son within the year (Gen 17:21; 18:14). Sarah had Isaac when Abraham was 100 years old (Gen 21:5), showing that God was true to His word.
The mentions of Abraham’s age also indicate how long he had to wait for God to fulfill His promise. Abraham was 75 years old when God first called him to leave Ur (Gen 12:4), 86 years old when Ishmael was born (Gen 16:16), and 100 years old when Isaac was finally born (Gen 21:5). Abraham waited 25 years for God to take the first step in fulfilling His promise to make him “a great nation” (Gen 12:2). During this period, Abraham faced many situations that tested his faith. Now, after God’s promise to provide an heir had finally been fulfilled, Abraham would face his greatest test of faith yet. Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 21:1–22:24). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

If this were merely a story about God fulfilling His promise, it could end here with Abraham and Sarah finally receiving the son and heir they had always hoped for. But the story of Abraham is also about his faith: the faith that drove him to leave his country at God’s command (Gen 12:4), the faith that led him to take up arms against mighty kings who kidnapped his kin (Gen 14:14–15), the faith that enabled him to circumcise every male in his household (Gen 17:23–27), and the faith that empowered him to bargain with God over the fate of the righteous in a wicked city (Gen 18:22–33). Abraham’s resolve had been tested repeatedly, and now it would be tested again—especially when it came to his relationships with his two sons. Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 21:1–22:24). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.</Text>

            <Text>“The Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did to Sarah as he had promised. And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him” (Genesis 21:1-2). Sarah gave birth to Isaac when Abraham was 100 years old, at the time appointed by the Lord. He had possibly grown accustomed to the idea that if things did not work out as promised, his eldest son Ishmael would be the inheritor. However, God planned His promise to unfold as it did to display His faithfulness and power. God always keeps His word, but the delay is often longer than we like and filled with various trials. During the interim we can learn to endure, to become stronger, to trust more, to pray and grow closer to God. As we do so, God will visit us just as He visited Sarah. He will gracefully provide us the strength we need to accomplish His will. Our attitude towards the Lord should be “I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted” (Job 42:1-2). </Text>

21 The Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did to Sarah as he had promised. 2 And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. 3 Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac. 4 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 5 Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. 6 And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.” 7 And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ge 21:1–7). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.


God Protects Hagar and Ishmael
8 And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. 9 But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing. 10 So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.” 11 And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son. 12 But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. 13 And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.” 14 So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 
15 When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes. 16 Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, “Let me not look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. 17 And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. 18 Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.” 19 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. 20 And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow. 21 He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.

James 2:18–26
18 But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. 
19 You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe—and shudder! 
20 Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? 
21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? 
22 You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; 
23 and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God. 
24 You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. 
25 And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? 
26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.

Hebrews 11:6
6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.


Christ might be given to those who believe. 
23 Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. 24 So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, 26 for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise.

23 Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. 24 So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. 25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, 26 for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise.

            <Title>Abraham is Obedient</Title>
            <Text>“Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him” (Genesis 21:4-5). Here, Abraham illustrates the fact that a living faith produces obedience. In Genesis 17:19 God commanded Abraham to name his future son ‘Isaac’. In addition, God instituted circumcision as the sign of the covenant and commanded Abraham to apply it to the males of his household (Genesis 17:10-14). Though not sinless, Abraham consistently obeyed God throughout his faith journey as shown here. Abraham made plenty of mistakes and committed many sins (including lying on more than one occasion), but he oriented his entire life towards God and His promises. The altars of worship he erected in Canaan testified of his relationship with the Lord (Genesis 12:7; 17:18). 
Like Abraham, we must meet God and His promises with faith and obedience. Hebrews 11:6 says, “And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.” The foundation of our relationship with God is complete trust in Him. The two components of this trust includes belief in God’s existence and belief that He will reward those who seek Him. The acceptance of God’s existence is a no-brainer for us, but we consistently face obstacles to “seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness” (Matthew 6:33). Oftentimes worries, concerns, and the pursuit of temporal things replace the diligent pursuit of God.  However, we must remember that the Lord has promised that the things we tend to worry about will be taken care of by God when we direct our first and best efforts to doing God’s will and looking forward to the return of Jesus. </Text>

            <Title>Hebrews 11.6 Commentaries</Title>
            <Text>6. The reference to Enoch’s faith is justified by the comment And without faith it is impossible to please him. Man’s relationship with God is built up on a mutual trust, and true communion cannot exist without this. 

The writer goes on, in fact, to point out something much more elementary, but which he clearly saw the need to mention. 

(i) Whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists. It has already been seen how central to this epistle is the idea of drawing near to God (4:16; 7:25; 10:1, 22). The present statement must, therefore, be regarded as linking Enoch’s experience with the whole purpose of the letter. It may seem strange that in an epistle which begins with an assertion of God (1:1), the writer should consider it necessary to point to the need for believing in his existence. But he is arguing from man’s experience of communion with God to the fact that his faith in God’s existence must be real. 

(ii) Such worshippers must also believe that he rewards those who seek him. This statement is intended to reassure those who are questioning whether the quest for God is always successful. It needs faith to accept this, but the conviction that God rewards the serious seeker is fully in harmony with the nature of God as he has made himself known throughout his revelations to men. There is no fear that any seeker may not find him if he acts in faith. Guthrie, D. (1983). Hebrews: An Introduction and Commentary (Vol. 15, pp. 231–232). Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press.

11:6. Without faith it is impossible to please God
The language of the first part of this verse is generally typical of Hebrews: χωρίς, → 4:15; ἀδύνατον, → 6:4; εὐαρεστῆσαι, → v. 5; δεῖ, → 2:1; προσερχόμενον, → 4:16.
Δέ (→ 1:13) introduces a new stage in the argument. In fact, it is the major premise of a syllogism of which v. 5c formed the minor premise, while the conclusion, “therefore, Enoch had faith,” is left implicit. See Hegermann 1961.22.
Ἀδύνατον: ἐστιν is implied, as for example in 6:4. The negative ἀδύνατον logically balances the following positive δεῖ. Clement of Alexandria (Strom. 2.8.4) adds both ἐστιν after ἀδύνατον and θεῷ after εὐαρεστῆσαι: a correct gloss. Δύνατος and cognates tend to require a following aorist infinitive (BD 338[2]).
Γάρ links vv. 5b and 6a with a corollary, the scope of which is broader than Enoch. It expresses two conditions of true worship, which are at the same time two components of faith: belief (1) that God exists, and (2) that he rewards those who seek him. The distinction between these points is heightened by the scribes of 206 216 326 1831, who added πρῶτον, and of 1836, who added πρότερον. The simple statement that God exists (ἔστιν absolutely, Bauer D I.1) has few if any biblical parallels. The practical atheism of those who live as though God did not exist is condemned in Pss. 13:1; 53(LXX 52):1; Wis. 12:13 affirms that there is no other God than the Lord. The influence of the LXX translation of YHWH as ὁ Ὤν (Ex. 3:14) may be traced through Wis. 13:1 to 1 Cor. 8:5; Rev. 11:17; 16:5, etc. A faint echo of Ex. 3:14 may be heard here, especially since Heb. 11:16 alludes to Ex. 3:6, 15. Greek discussion of God’s (or the gods’) existence, by contrast, is extensive: e.g., Philo, Op. Mundi 170; Epict. Diss. 2.14.11; Diod. Sic. 12.20.2. The abstract quality of the words ὅτι ἔστιν is, however, attenuated by the surrounding references to worship (προσερχόμενον … ἐκζητοῦσιν). Moreover, the second aspect of faith may be understood, not as correlative with the first, but as a consequence: “… that he exists, and therefore rewards” (Bauer s.v. καί, I.1f.). In any case, the speculative note is sounded only in passing; everywhere else in Hebrews (with the possible exception of πίστεως ἐπὶ θεόν, 6:1), the existence of God is presupposed.

Ἐκζητέω, though possibly stronger than the simple ζητέω, is not exclusively used of worship (→ 12:17*), though the context requires this meaning here. The language is that of OT devotion (Dt. 4:29; Pss. 34:4[LXX 33:5]; 69:32[LXX 68:33] and frequently of the Psalms; Acts 15:17 = Am. 9:12; cf. 1 Clem. 13:1). It is God himself who must be sought: there is no thought of philosophical investigation of propositions about God.
The thought of reward is common in the OT and even in the NT (H. Preisker in TDNT IV.695–728, here 701), though the word μισθαποδότης*** is probably a neologism (cf. μισθαποδοσία, → 4:2). The nature of the reward or goal of faith is not defined at this point, though it becomes progressively clearer as the chapter proceeds, and especially in 12:21–24. In Enoch’s case, the reward was doubtless that of removal by God from earth to heaven: the thought that God himself is the reward is not expressed here, or even in 12:23. Ellingworth, P. (1993).

            <Title>Sarah Rejoices</Title>
            <Text>“And Sarah said, ‘God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.’ And she said, ‘Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age’” (Genesis 21:6-7). Sarah’s unbelief turned to laughter. Isaac will be a living reminder that nothing is too hard for the Lord (Genesis 18:14). The God who created the universe out of nothing with His word can easily overcome infertility in a woman. Sarah personally knows what Jesus teaches through His word, that “with God all things are possible” (Matthew 19:26). Since God possesses omnipotent and unlimited power, His promises are guaranteed. Sarah’s experience should remind us that though the nights of loneliness, despair, and pain might be long, God will bring joy in the morning. 
Looking backward, we can rejoice with Sarah because through Isaac God fulfilled His promise to create a covenant people, Israel. Then, God fulfilled His promise of a divine Son through Israel. The virgin Mary’s conception of Jesus was different and much more miraculous than Sarah’s, who conceived through normal human intercourse. Mary rejoiced and magnified the Lord because Jesus was the ultimate fulfillment of the promise made the Abraham (Luke 2:46-55). We should rejoice in the Lord always, for since we are in Christ we are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to the same promise (Philippians 4:4; Galatians 3:29). A bright future awaits the people of God, for “according to his promise we are waiting for the new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells” (2 Peter 3:13).</Text>

            <Title>Hagar Cast Out</Title>
            <Text>The divine record does not provide a detailed account of Isaac’s childhood, except for one event which brought Abraham much sorrow. Among the Hebrew women the practice of training a child to eat food other than the mother’s milk (weaning) occurred when the child reached three or four years old (Powell, p. 1097). Abraham held a feast to celebrate Isaac’s weaning, but when Sarah notices Ishmael mocking the occasion she demands that Abraham send Hagar and Ishmael away from the family (Genesis 21:8-10). Sarah does not want Hagar or Ishmael to have any share of Isaac’s inheritance. The web of jealousy and bitterness that was spun years ago had become much more entangled with anger, resentment, and malice. Ishmael sinned by mocking the child of promise and Sarah sinned by over-reacting with cruelty. The conflict that had simmered in Abraham’s household for years was now boiling over.
Sarah’s ultimatum emotionally lodged Abraham heart between a rock and a hard place because he deeply loved Ishmael, but God used the conflict to accomplish His purpose: “Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring” (Genesis 21:12-13). The Lord treasured both Isaac and Ishmael. By faith, Abraham sent Hagar and Ishmael away as the Lord commanded, trusting God’s ability to protect them and fulfill His promise (Genesis 21:14). God does indeed protect and provide for them and was with Ishmael as he grew up (Genesis 21:15-21).  Because of His great love for Abraham, God blessed Ishmael even though he does not participate in promises given to the elect line of Isaac.</Text>

weaning, the practice of training a child to eat food other than mother’s milk. In biblical times it was an occasion to celebrate when a child was weaned (Gen. 21:8). It marked Samuel’s departure for special training (1 Sam. 1:21–28). A weaned child symbolized the peaceable kingdom of the Messiah (Isa. 11:8) or the helpless result of a delinquent leadership (28:9). Powell, M. A. (Ed.). (2011). weaning.

            <Title>FF Bruce</Title>
            <Text>Paul now inverts the exegesis which would have commended itself to him in earlier days. 

Now it is the people of the law who are the offspring of the slave woman; the children of the free woman are those who embrace the gospel of justification by faith, comprising a minority of Jews and a rapidly increasing preponderance of Gentiles. 

To Jews this exegesis must have seemed preposterous. It was crystal clear that they were Sarah’s offspring, while Hagar’s descendants were Gentiles. One could envisage a group like the Qumran community claiming that its members alone, because of their special devotion to the law, were sons of the promise, while the apostate majority of Israel deserved to be ranked with the Ishmaelites; but that bears no resemblance to Paul’s argument. 

For Paul, law and promise are antithetical. His own experience had convinced him that the law brought men and women into bondage, while the gospel was a message of liberation. Therefore, he argues, the people of the law belong to Hagar’s family, for she ‘is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery’; those who believe the gospel are the children of Sarah, the free woman. We cannot know how convincing Paul’s Gentile readers found this argument; much would depend on the degree to which they had assimilated his principles of OT interpretation.

What Paul had learned from his personal experience corresponded with his reading of history of God’s dealings with mankind. The gospel is the fulfilment of the promise made to Abraham that in him and his offspring all nations would be blessed (cf. 3:8, 16). The law, which was given later, was a parenthetical dispensation introduced by God for a limited purpose; its validity continued only until the promise to Abraham was fulfilled in Christ, and even while it was valid it did not modify the terms of the promise (cf. 3:17–25).

 Bruce, F. F. (1982). The Epistle to the Galatians: a commentary on the Greek text (p. 219). Grand Rapids, MI: W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co.

The identification of Hagar with Sinai means simply that she and her descendants represent the law, which holds men and women in bondage. If she also corresponds to the present Jerusalem συστοιχεῖ δὲ τῇ νῦν Ἰερουσαλήμ), it is not so much the literal city that is meant as the whole legal system of Judaism, which had its world-centre in Jerusalem. If Paul’s opponents were trying to bring his Galatian converts into subjection to the church of Jerusalem and its leadership, that would add point to Paul’s reference to ‘the present Jerusalem’. 

The leaders of the Jerusalem church had reached an accommodation with Paul about the gospel which he preached and his commission to propagate it in the Gentile world (2:1–9); if they were now going back on that agreement, if they were party to the attempt to impose the yoke of the law on the Gentile churches of Galatia (a charge against them to which Paul does not commit himself), then they would be making a common cause with the community which is still ‘in slavery with her children’.

            <Text>In this chapter we see the sovereign grace of God in full display. Within a year of Isaac’s birth, Abraham foolishly reverts to ‘old Abram’ and jeopardizes his role in God’s plan of redemption. Fortunately, God extended mercy to Abraham and Sarah but justice to Abimelech, who had been deceived by Abraham. We must remember that “when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit” (Titus 3:5). As Christians, we all stand on the grace of God and must remember that our salvation does not depend on the good things we have done.
Also we see that God has imprinted upon the human soul His moral standards for living. We are all formed in the image of God and according to the apostle Paul, all men are without excuse because God has given a general revelation of Himself (Romans 1:19-20). These fundamental truths forms the basis of God’s interaction with humanity, as we see in the case of Abimelech. God will hold every person accountable because He has provided sufficient revelation of Himself and his moral standard to all people. 
However, as Christians must remember that we are the instrumental means by which God bring salvation to a lost world. Although Abraham sinned against and deceived Abimelech, he remained God’s elect instrument of salvation in the situation. The oft repeated criticism that the church is full of hypocrites should not quench our passion for spreading the gospel to all people. The hope we are to offer to others is not sinless perfection. The hope we offer is eternal, abundant life with God through Jesus Christ that begins now but is brought to full realization in the new heavens and earth. 
We would think that by this time in his life Abraham would have achieved complete victory over the fear of man and circumstances. He had stood face to face with the Lord and witnessed His awesome power. God had spoken to Him in various ways at different times to reassure him. However, fear and doubt continued to plague Abraham. Like Abraham, we must face and acknowledge the persistence of sin in our lives. The apostle Paul expressed his frustrations with sin in his own life (Romans 7:15). However, Paul reflections ended on a note of victory. He reminds us that in Christ we have the spiritual resources we need to overcome sin (Romans 7:24-25). </Text>

            <Title>Genesis 20</Title>
            <Text>Overview
Question: How do you respond to repeated failures, weaknesses and sins?

Gen 20:1–2
Abraham moves to Gerar, in the territory of the Negeb between Kadesh and Shur and repeats his earlier mistake, claiming that Sarah is his sister (Gen 20:1–2).

From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. 2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. 

Gur, “To Sojourn.” The verb gur means “to live temporarily in a foreign land.”
The precarious nature of sojourning that characterized the account of Lot’s guests continues as Abraham sojourns among foreigners in Gerar.
Abraham’s sojourn in Gerar echoes an earlier trip to Egypt, where Pharaoh seized the beautiful Sarah only to have his house afflicted with plagues from God (Gen 12:10–20).

Gen 20:3–7
Taking Abraham at his word, Abimelech, the king of Gerar, takes Sarah into his harem, but before he touches her, God appears to him in a dream. God reveals to Abimelech that Sarah is Abraham’s wife and declares that he will die for taking her.

. 3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.” 4 Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, “Lord, will you kill an innocent people? 5 Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’ And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.” 6 Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. 7 Now then, return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.” 

How did the king respond? (4-5)
He defends his innocence
Because of general revelation, people recognize the sacred character of marriage (cf. Lev. 20:22; Deut. 22:22).
Tam Levav, “Integrity of Heart.”
The expression combines two common Hebrew words: tam, meaning “completeness,” and lebab (or leb), meaning “heart.” It refers to upright conduct or sincerity of action.
What did God say He had done to keep the king from sinning (6)
God did not let Abimelech have sexual relations with Sarah 
The primary significance of Gen 20 in the OT is its formal introduction of the role of a prophet
Abraham is the first “prophet” in the Bible (Gen 20:7). The Hebrew word used most often to refer to a prophet is navi’, which occurs more than 300 times in the OT.
Many connect the status to Abraham’s reception of divine revelation in the Sodom incident
This appearance also clearly identifies Abraham as a prophet who is given foreknowledge of God’s plans and judgments.
Others identify Abraham’s role as an intercessor as his qualification for the title “prophet”
Abraham’s compassion and sense of righteousness and justice prove him a worthy prophet. 
He pleads, like the weeping prophet Jeremiah, for the deliverance of the righteous in Sodom and Gomorrah.
Abraham intercedes as a prophet, not as one who has been wronged (unlike Num. 12 and Job 42). 
In his role as intercessor for the Gentiles, he prefigures Jesus Christ (Isa. 53:12; Rom. 8:34). 
We in the church are often sinful and failing, but still we are called to be the intercessors for those who do not receive Jesus Christ.
Contra Jonah

Gen 20:8-10
God promises to spare the king if he promises to return Sarah. The next day, Abimelech summons Abraham, asking why he has endangered Abimelech’s house by lying about his wife.

8 So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid. 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.” 10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you did this thing?” 
Abimelech response reflects a widespread ancient Near Eastern value that adultery was “the great sin” (Hamilton 1995, 67). 
Legal documents from Ugarit, Egypt, and elsewhere in the ancient Near East indicate that adultery was an unacceptable practice (Sarna 1989, 143). 
Hittite law bears strong similarity to the situation in Gen 20; an adulterer who could prove his ignorance of a woman’s marital status at the time of the offense was acquitted of his crime (Mathews 2005, 252).

Gen 20:11–16
After Abraham explains his actions, Abimelech returns Sarah and gives Abraham a generous gift. 

11 Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, ‘There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ 12 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. 13 And when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ”
14 Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. 15 And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.” 16 To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.” 

How did Abraham justify his conduct? What arrangement did Sarah and Abraham have that led to this deceit? (Question: How do you respond to repeated failures, weaknesses and sins?)
Abraham defends himself to Abimelech, saying that Sarah is his half sister, and he had asked her to identify herself as his sister whenever they traveled
To make matters worse, Abraham now incriminates both God and Sarah. The verb Abraham uses for wander (tāʿá) means to wander about hopelessly and aimlessly often in a hostile environment
Sarah is named as a consenting member in the trick.
Marriage to a half sister is prohibited by later Israelite law, but during the time of the patriarchs, it was culturally acceptable (compare Lev 18:9, 11; Deut 27:22)
Leviticus 18:9
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether brought up in the family or in another home.
Leviticus 18:11
You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, brought up in your father’s family, since she is your sister.
Deuteronomy 27:22
Cursed be anyone who lies with his sister, whether the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’
Abimelech gives gifts to Abraham (20:14–15) and to Sarah (20:16) to honor God and their special relationship with him, not to compensate for guilt (cf. 12:19–20). 
a thousand shekels. This is a fabulously large sum. A Babylonian laborer, usually paid a half shekel per month, would have had to work 167 years to earn such a sum.
God not only delivers his elect out of dreadful peril but blesses them with unexpected and undeserved riches

Gen 20:17-18
God has closed the wombs of the women of the king’s house, but when Abraham prays for Abimelech’s house, God blesses it with children ().

17 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. 18 For the Lord had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife. [1]


[1] The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2001). (Ge 20:1–18). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.

If God can answer Abraham’s prayer for sterile pagan women, how much more for Abraham’s wife?

Theological reflections 
God’s sovereign grace is clearly revealed in this chapter. 
On the brink of Isaac’s conception (see 18:10–14; 21:1–2), Abraham places the program of redemption in jeopardy. 
God extends justice to Abimelech but mercy to Abraham and Sarah. 
Salvation depends on the faithful Lord, not on his unfaithful servants.
Application 
reflect on the sins and bad decisions I have made and remember that my salvation does not depend on those things
Remember that I stand in grace and must learn to think in grace
There is a general “moral standard” to which all people adhere. (“Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.” 20:3)
Genesis begins with the formation of every person in the image of God. 
According to Paul, God has given everyone a general revelation of himself (Rom. 1:19–20)
It is on this basis that God judges and interacts with humanity.
Abraham provides a model for the Christian in the modern pluralistic world. In that world, God holds each person accountable for a fundamental fear of God and essential consideration of human relationships.. 
Although Abraham is in the wrong, Abimelech must ask Abraham, God’s elect instrument of salvation, to intercede for him. 
God’s human covenant partner, who nearly brought death to Abimelech by his scheming (20:3), is still the means by which God gives life and blessing (20:17–18).
We in the church are often sinful and failing, but still we are called to be the intercessors for those who do not receive Jesus
We might have hoped that by this time in Abraham’s life, he would be able to trust God with Sarah. Instead, Abraham’s fear and doubt lead him to a familiar sin. 
Like Abraham, we face the frustration of our weaknesses and sins. 
The Apostle Paul expresses this shared frustration in Rom 7:14–25: “I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate” (Rom 7:15 nrsv). 
But Paul’s reflections do not end with this despair. He reminds us that, by the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit, we are able to overcome sin: “Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord” (Rom 7:24–25a).

2. Who was king in that area?

Abimelech

3. What deceit did Abraham do, and where else in Genesis do we find that he did a similar thing?

He told King Abimelech that Sarah was his sister. He did the same thing in Egypt in Genesis 13.

4. What did God say to the king about it and how did the king respond?

God told the king he was as good as dead for taking Sarah. The king responded with fearful innocence.

5. What did God say He had done to keep the king from sinning, and what did He tell the king to do about the situation?

God did not let Abimelech have sexual relations with Sarah and told him to return her to Abraham

6. What did the king say to Abraham about it?

The king asked Abraham why did he do such a thing to him? Why did he lie and put his kingdom in danger’s way?

7. How did Abraham justify his conduct? (Think: As the situation unfolded, who appears to have the greater fear of God, Abraham or Abimelech?)

Abraham justified his conduct with the half-truth, that Sarah was his half sister through his father

8. What arrangement did Sarah and Abraham have that led to this deceit? (Think: How old was Sarah at this time and what does that tell you about her?)

That wherever they sojourned Sarah would say that Abraham is only her brother.

9. What did Abimelech do to compensate Abraham and Sarah?

Abimelech gave Abraham sheep, oxen, servants, and silver.

10. What did Abraham do for Abimelech and his people, and why was this needed?

Abraham prayed to God for Abimelech which was needed because God had caused all the women to be barren in the king’s household.

            <Text>Keep in Step with the Spirit
16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. 17 For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, 20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, 21 envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. 24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

17 But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not! 18 For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor. 19 For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. 20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 21 I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.

            <Text>N.	Abraham Fell Back into Sin: Keeping Faith—How God Keeps and Secures the Believer Even Through Sin, 20:1–18
(20:1–18) Introduction—God, Keeping Power—Assurance—Security: God keeps His people throughout life, even through sin. God’s pure grace and glorious power carries His people through all the trials of life. This passage is a clear picture of what God means by working all things out for good to those who love Him and are called according to His purpose (Ro. 8:28).
Here is the picture: on the very eve of one of the greatest moments in Abraham’s life (the long hoped for son), he sinned again, sinned terribly. And by his sin, he imperiled and jeopardized the hope. Once again, God was forced to intervene on his behalf. God showed His eternal mercy by keeping and preserving His dear follower, even through his terrible sin. Abraham was saved and kept by God and by God alone. God took the initiative to intervene on Abraham’s behalf. By such, he showed Abraham and all succeeding generations that it is His grace and His grace alone that continues to save and keep the believer. The believer is shown to be what he really is: a believer yes, but a frail, mortal, depraved human being. He is but a poor sinner who is saved and kept by God’s pure grace and glorious power.

Time and again throughout Genesis and the rest of the Bible, God is seen delivering and keeping His servants, even through sin (note, not from sin but through sin). God’s servants are shown to be mere men, totally depraved men. As stated, they are seen as frail mortals and poor sinners who not only have to be saved but kept by God’s pure grace and glorious power.

The question naturally arises, why? Why does God deliver and keep His people—even through sin—when they are depraved and show their depravity by sinning so often? Why does God continue to save believers when they come so short of God’s glory (Ro. 3:23)? Why does God not just cast off His people, judge and erase them from His memory forever? Scripture gives one supreme reason. It is revealed in the New Testament.

God loves His only Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, supremely; and God has made one supreme promise to Him: that He shall have many adopted brothers and sisters, a family created “in the image of God” and “conformed to the image of Christ.” (See Deeper Study # 1—Ge. 1:26; 1 Jn. 3:2.) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 108–109). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


The point is this: Abraham had a lapse of faith; he once again failed to trust God to take care of him and left the promised land. True, he did not go all the way back down into Egypt, but he almost did: he went right up the border of Egypt, to the city of Gerar, the city that was then the prosperous and thriving capital of the Philistines.
Abraham probably moved to Gerar because it was the capital, the largest market for his business transactions. But he should have never made the move; he should have moved to other cities within the heart of the promised land, trusting God to help him establish markets there. But his faith in God wavered, weakened, and eventually collapsed. He just could not see how he could maintain his business and other holdings unless he lived close by a large city. Thus, he once again made a decision on his own without God, made a decision based on his own human reasoning. Abraham forsook the promised land.
b. Abraham deceived and lied to others. One sin always leads to another sin. Having left the promised land for a strange country, Abraham began to fear for his own personal safety. He allowed thoughts of doubt and evil to enter his mind: “Would the noblemen and king of Gerar kill him in order to take Sarah as wife? Was it God’s will for him to leave Hebron? To move to the land of the Philistines, to their capital? Should he have remained in Hebron, trusting God to help him? If he had made a mistake, would God help him now?”
When Abraham reached the capital, he gave in to the doubts and evil thoughts. Sin after sin began to be heaped one upon another.
⇒	Abraham was overcome by doubt and fear: he doubted the care and provision of God and feared that the noblemen and king might kill him in order to take Sarah.
⇒	Abraham lied, claiming that Sarah was his sister, not his wife. And Abimelech, the king, took Sarah into his harem. (Note: Abimelech was a title for the ruler, not a personal name.)
⇒	Abraham acted selfishly, putting his own safety first and risking the safety, honor, and purity of Sarah. He was willing for her to be sexually abused, to commit adultery, and to be endangered if she displeased the man—all to save his own neck. And remember, Sarah was pregnant at this time, pregnant with the promised son, Isaac.
Abraham’s sin was great indeed, just unbelievable at this stage of his life and spiritual maturity. But here he was, falling into gross sin during the most important time of his life, sinning when the most important event of his life was about to take place: the birth of the promised son. Here he was endangering the very purpose and will of God to send the promised seed to earth, endangering the very life of Sarah and the child within her.
Thought 1. Abraham forsook the promised land. Abraham forgot …
•	that the Lord is “the Almighty God” (Ge. 17:1)
•	that nothing is too hard for the Lord, that the Lord has the power to do all things (Ge. 18:14)
We must never forget who God is, never forget His omnipotent, unlimited power to help us. We must never stop seeking the promised land of heaven. No matter how great a trial confronts us, we must never cave in and leave the promised land. We must not backslide. God will help us and look after us if we will only trust Him. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 110). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
2 (20:3–7) Security—God, Names: God secured the believer by a miraculous intervention. Abraham had sinned, sinned tragically. As stated, he was endangering the purpose of God to send the promised son, endangering the very life of Sarah who was pregnant with the promised son. God could not allow this; He could not allow His purpose to be stopped. The promised seed (son) had to be born so that the promised line could be continued and the Savior of the world could be born sometime in the future, just as God had promised. What was God to do? Abraham and Sarah were out of God’s will, walking after the flesh; they were in a predicament, unable to handle the situation. All seemed lost: they were helpless to straighten out the mess into which they had gotten. There was only one thing to do: God Himself had to intervene. And this He did. God appeared to Abimelech in a dream one night.
a. God warned the king of judgment. Abimelech was in danger of dying because he was about to commit adultery with Sarah. Note the seriousness of adultery in God’s eyes. The world of Abraham’s day was an immoral world. Immorality—free sex, loose sex, all kinds of sex—ran wild. People did their own thing; did what they wanted when they wanted. Pologamy—having many wives—was the common practice, and the wealthy often had harems of concubines. One wife for one man was a rarity, if it existed at all. But again, note God’s attitude in dealing with this perverted and immoral king: the law of God still stood. Adultery was still a sin, and it was to be punished. Abimelech was as good as dead if he touched Sarah.
b. The king appealed to the Lord. He claimed that he and his people were innocent and blameless, for he had not gone near Sarah. Moreover, he had no idea that she was Abraham’s wife, for they had both claimed to be brother and sister (vv. 4–5).
Now, note that Abimelech called God “the Lord” (Adonai). The Hebrew means Lord of All. Abimelech apparently was God-fearing and recognized that the God of his dream was the Lord of all. This is seen in two facts.
⇒	He acknowledged that the Lord had the power over all persons and nations. Note the question he asked: Was the Lord going to destroy an innocent nation, him and his people (v. 4)?
⇒	He acknowledged that the Lord was just and righteous; He did not punish people unjustly. Note what he said to the Lord: the Lord must know that the king had acted in the integrity of his heart, that his conscience was clear and his hands clean in the whole affair (v. 5).
c. God then revealed Himself to Abimelech as the true God (Ha ‘elohim). The Hebrew actually means the true God. Abimelech was not only talking with the Lord of All (Adonai) in his dream, but he was talking with the true God (Ha ‘elohim). God revealed three things to Abimelech:
⇒	The true God has knowledge of all: He knew that the king was innocent (v. 6a).
⇒	The true God has power over all persons and their affairs: He had kept Abimelech from touching Sarah. God had actually afflicted the king and his household with some kind of disease that kept them from having sex and bearing children (v. 6b; see vv. 17–18).
⇒	The true God expected and demanded that the king not commit adultery, that he return Sarah to Abraham (v. 7). Note that God told the king that Abraham was a prophet and that Abraham would pray for the king’s healing. But if he refused to return Sarah, he would die, he and his whole family (v. 7).
The point is this: God cared for Abraham and Sarah; moreover, He could not allow His promise to be stopped. The promised son had to be born through Sarah. Thus God had to intervene on behalf of His two believers, intervene despite their terrible sin. God had to miraculously step in to save Sarah from being touched by the king (v. 6b). This He did by striking fear—the fear of God—into the heart of Abimelech. Abimelech was to die if he did not listen to God and turn away from committing adultery with Sarah.
Thought 1. God has the power to save and keep the believer. He can do whatever is necessary to keep the believer, even intervene miraculously. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 111). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


4 (20:11–13) Confession: God secured the believer through an honest confession of sin. Remember, Abraham did not know that God had appeared to the king in a dream. In Abraham’s mind, he had only one hope, only one chance to save himself before the king: tell the truth. He had to confess his sin and shame, trusting that God would move upon the king’s heart to spare him from execution. Abraham was, of course, confessing before God while he was confessing to the king. In fact, confessing to a person that one has sinned against him is the most difficult confession to make. Note Abraham’s confession.
a. He confessed the sin of fear, of not trusting God to take care of him and Sarah (v. 1). Abraham confessed that he feared the Philistines, that they would kill him for his wife. Note why he feared them: because he did not sense a fear of God among the Philistines. They were living just as all the other people in Canaan were: living selfish, immoral and lawless lives. Consequently, Abraham feared that their selfish, immoral, and lawless spirit would take action against him. He just failed to trust God’s care; his fear was greater than his trust of God, at least in these circumstances.
b. He confessed the sin of lying, of twisting the truth, of telling half-truths (v. 12). Sarah was his half-sister, the daughter of his father, not of his mother.
c. Abraham confessed the sin of misusing and exploiting people (v. 13). Abraham confessed that he had made this claim throughout his life, that he had led Sarah to go along with the scheme from the beginning of their journey to the promised land (v. 13). This was a horrible sin: that of misusing and exploiting Sarah, of dishonoring and shaming her, and of risking her life if the king or noblemen were displeased with her. It is possible that the king Abimelech had taken Sarah into his harem in order to make an alliance with Abraham. Remember, Abraham was a powerful sheik at that time. Nevertheless, Abraham had lied and misused Sarah to protect his own life, and he stood guilty of the charges: he had shamed and dishonored his wife, misused her to protect himself. This must have been an extremely difficult confession to make. But Abraham had to confess the sin, for he was guilty before God and the king.
Thought 1. God keeps and secures us through confession of sins. We are saved and we are kept by confession. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 113). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. God often keeps and secures the believer through a human rebuke and chastisement, through the rebuke and chastisement of other people. In love, God sees to it that we are rebuked and chastised so that we will be embarrassed and shamed and stop our sin and live like we should.

            <Text>In Galatians 5:17 the apostle Paul wrote, “For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.” The ongoing struggle with sin is a reality for the Christian journey. We will always feel the pull of the flesh as long we are in this world. There are times when we all cave into fear, anger, lust, etc. How should we respond to repeated failures, weaknesses, and sins? How can we gain victory over those bad habits that continue linger in our lives?
Abraham faced the same struggles and sins as we do today. As he continued to pursue God’s promise he faced dangerous situations that challenged his faith. Now on the very eve of the fulfillment of God’s promise to provide an heir, Abraham reverted to an old sin in order to protect himself: deception. Time and again men and women of faith in the Scriptures remind us, through their own failures and sins, that we all have feet of clay. And thus, time and time again we are reminded of God’s amazing grace and steadfast love.</Text>

            <Text>“From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, ‘She is my sister.’ And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah” (Genesis 20:1-2). After the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, for some reason Abraham journeyed to Gerar. Once there, he repeats the earlier sin he committed in Egypt, claiming that Sarah is his sister. As we discovered in the account of the angel’s visit with Lot, traveling in foreign lands proved to be quite dangerous. Instead of trusting God’s protection, Abraham resorts to deception in order to protect himself at the expense of Sarah. Even after having dined with the Lord and having witnessed the awesome display of God’s power in the destruction of Sodom, Abraham resorted to self-reliance in order to escape danger. 
Abraham’s experience reflects our own: we often repeat the same old sins and mistakes. Like Abraham, in our faith journey moments of great displays of faith are often intermingled with moments of disobedience. Oftentimes, the moments of disobedience are occasioned by a lack of prayerful diligence. On the eve of his crucifixion, Jesus warned his disciples to “watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation” (Matthew 26:40). He issued this warning because despite our best intentions, challenging circumstances will arise to test our resolve.  Like Peter who displayed overconfidence in self but still denied the Lord, we will resort to our old, sinful responses when depending on our own resources to deal with trials and temptations.

            <Title>The Ongoing Need for God's Grace</Title>
            <Text>Abraham repeated the same old sin and endangered the purpose of God by risking Sarah’s life, but God gracefully intervened to straighten out the mess. Abimelech, the king of Gerar had taken Sarah but before he had sexual contact with her, God appeared to him in a dream. God warned Abimelech that he was a good as dead for taking Sarah (Genesis 20:3). The king responded by defending his innocence - he had been deceived by Abraham’s brother-sister narrative. Abimlech’s response reveals that people outside of the covenant have God’s moral law stamped on their conscience. For one, he acknowledged the sanctity of marriage. Two, Abimelech acknowledged God’s sovereignty over nations and three, he appealed to God’s justice and righteousness (Genesis 20:4-5). The Lord struck fear in Abimelech’s heart and commanded him to return Sarah. In turn, Abraham, who is a prophet, would pray for Abimelech and his people.
In this passage, Abimelech’s character shines more brightly than does Abaraham’s. However, God does not abandon Abraham despite his grave mistake. He intervenes to save Sarah, to preserve the seed promise, to save Abimelech, and to restore Abraham. What a wonderful picture of grace and mercy! Just as God powerfully intervened to deliver the covenant couple from their, He has given us the power to overcome those old sinful habits that seek to pull us down. Our power is found in the indwelling Holy Spirit, given to us by God as a guarantee of protection and victory over sin. We will always struggle against the desires of the old man. However, as we prayerfully commune with God, renew our minds with and obey Scripture, and seek encouragement from the fellowship of the saints, the Spirit will give us the inner strength to resist sin.</Text>

            <Title>The Ongoing Need for Repentance</Title>
            <Text>The experience of God’s grace and mercy must be met with repentance. God used Abimelech’s fear of the Lord to highlight Abraham’s need for repentance. After hearing from the Lord, Abimelech summoned Abraham, asking why did he endanger Abimelech’s kingdom by lying about Sarah. Hamilton notes that Abimelech’s response reflects a widespread ancient Near East value that adultery was “the great sin” (Hamilton, p. 67). His response also shows that Abraham’s sin had a wider range of impact than he may have thought. Such is the nature of sin. Abraham attempted to justify his conduct with the premise that Abimelech and his people did not fear the Lord (Genesis 20:11). Next, he attempted to cover up his deception by revealing that Sarah was truly his half-sister. Finally, he shifts responsibility by saying it was God who caused him to wander in hostile environments and thereby, Sarah consented from the beginning of their journeys to use the brother-sister trick to escape from danger! Thus we learn that through years of journeying and fellowship with, Abraham never relinquished the deceitful brother-sister narrative. 
Again, Abraham’s experience is often our own. We allow the fear of man and circumstances to drive us to act in ways contrary to God’s will. At times, selfishness may drive our behaviors. We hold on to sinful habits deemed somewhat non-trivial, such as impatience, pride, gossip, judgmental attitudes, etc. God will providentially arrange circumstances through which we will become aware of the seriousness of sins which we deem ‘respectable’. Just as God used Abimelech to rebuke Abraham, He will use people in our lives to correct and make us aware of the gravity of our sins. Our daily prayers should include petitions for the Lord to search our hearts and try our thoughts in order to reveal any grievous sins in our lives and to lead us in the everlasting way (Psalms 139:23-24)!
Through God’s mercy, Abimelech returned Sarah to Abraham with generous gifts. In return, Abraham prayed to God to heal Abimelech’s wife and female slaves who had become sterile through the ordeal (Genesis 20:17-18). This act of compassionate intercession reveals Abraham’s penitent heart. Along with the sense of justice and righteous he displayed when interceding for Sodom, it also shows him to be a worthy prophet. Like Abraham, we in the church cannot claim sinless perfection, but we are called to promote justice in the world and to intercede for the lost around us.

            <Text>Abraham and Abimelech
20 From there Abraham journeyed toward the territory of the Negeb and lived between Kadesh and Shur; and he sojourned in Gerar. 2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. 3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken, for she is a man’s wife.” 4 Now Abimelech had not approached her. So he said, “Lord, will you kill an innocent people? 5 Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.” 6 Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did not let you touch her. 7 Now then, return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and you shall live. But if you do not return her, know that you shall surely die, you and all who are yours.” 

8 So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things. And the men were very much afraid. 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be done.” 10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you did this thing?” 11 Abraham said, “I did it because I thought, ‘There is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ 12 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. 13 And when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you must do me: at every place to which we come, say of me, “He is my brother.” ’ ” 

14 Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male servants and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. 15 And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; dwell where it pleases you.” 16 To Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is a sign of your innocence in the eyes of all who are with you, and before everyone you are vindicated.” 17 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, and also healed his wife and female slaves so that they bore children. 18 For the Lord had closed all the wombs of the house of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.

            <Text>If one views them as two separate events, then the Scriptures are showing that the postcovenant Abraham, for all his spiritual maturation (e.g., Gen. 15:6), is still much like the precovenant Abraham.

The entire OT is replete with examples of individuals who display continuity between precovenant and postcovenant behavior; or perhaps more accurately, the OT is replete with illustrations of individuals who, though postcovenant, live as if they were precovenant. Abraham is not alone in illustrating moments of greatness intermingled with moments of disobedience and shortsightedness. This inconsistency is also present in the NT, say, in 1 Corinthians, in which a congregation of believers, styled by Paul as “sanctified in Christ Jesus” (1 Cor. 1:1), finds itself involved in all sorts of unsanctified circumstances, from dissensions to litigation to immorality. In the case of OT instances of such Jekyl-and-Hyde behavior, it would appear that the only beacon of hope for a more consistent, God-glorifying covenant life-style is that envisioned by the provisions of promised new covenant (Jer. 31:31–34; Ezek. 36:22–32; Joel 3:1–4 [Eng. 2:28–32]). In the NT instances such behavior must been seen as an aberration, rather than as an expected, normal pattern of the justified life. Indeed, Rom. 7:13ff. is the main Pauline passage used within Lutheran and Reformed traditions to buttress the concept of the bondage of the will, even the will of the redeemed. It pictures a seething, civil war raging within the life of Paul, resulting in failure to do the good and an inability not to do the evil.

I am inclined to believe that what Paul does in the autobiographical section of Rom. 7:13ff. is to trace his unregenerate experience while under law, before Christ, not his experience under Christ. I would suggest this view primarily on the grounds that the order in chs. 6 and 7 is logical rather than psychological or historical. Paul’s statements about justification and sanctification (ch. 6) raise questions about law (ch. 7), particularly whether Paul is implying that the law is evil. The natural thing to do in answering such a question is to talk about his experience under the law. Hamilton, V. P. (1995). The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18–50 (pp. 59–60). Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B.

Gen 22:1–2
In Genesis 22, God tests Abraham by commanding him to sacrifice his son, Isaac. 

After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2 He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.”

Abraham’s faith, which has been challenged repeatedly and with inconsistent success throughout the narrative, meets its greatest challenge here.

Key word study: “To test”
The Hebrew word “tested” does not mean “to entice to do wrong.” With a personal object it means “test another to see whether the other proves worthy” (1 Kings 10:1; 2 Chron. 9:1; Dan. 1:12, 14). 
Sometimes it refers to God’s testing of a person (e.g., Abraham in Gen 22:1; Hezekiah in 2 Chr 32:31; the psalmist in Psalm 26:2). 
Reasons for God’s testing individuals include:
To prove the genuineness of our faith (1 Peter 1:6-7)
To develop character (Jas 1:2-4)
To strengthen us 
Means by which God tests us include
Satanic opposition (Job 2:7; Luke 22:31 - Peter; Rev 2:10)
Difficult circumstances (2 Cor. 11:25-27)
25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea; 26 on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers; 27 in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. 28 And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant? 
Persecutions (Heb. 11:35-38)
People
More commonly testing speaks of God’s testing of the Israelites as a group (e.g., Exod 15:25; Deut 6:16; Judg 3:1). Many of God’s tests took place during Israel’s years in the wilderness, which the ot portrays generally as a time of testing:
Reasons for God’s testing of Israel
To refine them Zec 13:8-9 
To prove their obedience Ex 16:4 
To prove their love for him Dt 13:1-3
Will the Israelites take freedom with all the insecurities that freedom brings, or will they take incarceration and the guarantee of regular meals? That is the test” (Hamilton 1995, 101; see Exod 16:4; 20:20; Deut 8:2, 16; 13:3).
Youngblood summarizes, “Satan tempts us to destroy us (1 Peter 5:8; James 1:15; Rom. 6:23), but God tests us to strengthen us (Ex. 20:20; Deut. 8:2).” 
Humans can also test God, as Israel did repeatedly in the wilderness. Those who test God are usually motivated by lack of trust
(Exod 17:2, 7; Num 14:22; Deut 6:16; Ps 78:18-22)
Here the saint is torn between his faith in the divine promises and the command to nullify them, between his affection for God’s gift and for God. Faith is living within the vision of trusting God and his promises.
List at least 4 ways you can think of why this would be hard for Abraham to do (remember all we have studied regarding the birth of Isaac and the promises God had made regarding him).
Isaac was the elect son through whom God would fulfill His promises to Abraham. 
Abraham and Sarah waited their entire lives for the birth of Isaac

Gen 22:3
Abraham acts in obedience, departing with Isaac and two servants for Moriah (). 

So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him

Despite the difficulties, how did Abraham show his willingness to obey God? (Think: What applications can we make to people who postpone or neglect to obey God?)
He arose early in the morning, demonstrating urgency in submitting himself to God’s command.
Obedience to the will of God demonstrates the reality of a person’s faith in Jesus Christ.
“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Matthew 7:21
Faith without works is dead (James 2:14-26). Holding to “orthodox” belief alone does no good.
faith demands radical obedience. Abraham is asked to behave in a way that it is illogical, absurd, and, to say the least, nonconventional from the human perspective. Within the biblical world view, however, such radical behavior proves the true nature of biblical faith.

Gen 22:4–6
After three days, the father and son leave the servants and continue on together to the place of sacrifice. 

On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. 5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.” 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together.

Gen 22:7–8
On the way, Isaac asks his father where the lamb is for the burnt offering, and Abraham assures him that God will provide it. 

And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” 8 Abraham said, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together.

Gen 22:9
Abraham then builds an altar, binds Isaac, and places him on top of the wood. 

When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.

Gen 22:10–12
As Abraham takes the knife to kill his son, the Angel of Yahweh calls out to stop him (). 

Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. 11 But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 12 He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”

What did God say regarding Abraham’s willingness to offer Isaac? (Think: What sacrifices does God expect us to make for Him?)
Abraham's willingness to offer Isaac demonstrated his fear of God. 
The conditions of discipleship Mt 10:37-39
37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. 38 And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. 
The cost of discipleship involves the denial of self-interests and desires
Examples of self denial
Moses 24 By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25 choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin (Heb 11:24–25).
Jesus, the ultimate example 4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. 5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, 6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, 7 but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. 8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. (Php 2:4–8).
Find and list verses in the NT that refer to this event. According to Hebrews, what did Abraham believe God could do if he did kill Isaac?
The author of Hebrews cites Abraham’s faith in God’s promises and His ability to raise Isaac from the dead after he sacrificed him (Heb 11:17–19)
By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, 18 of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” 19 He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
Reasons for God’s testing individuals include:
To prove the genuineness of our faith (1 Peter 1:6-7)
To develop character and mature our faith (Jas 1:2-4)
To strengthen us 

Gen 22:13–14
Abraham has proven his fear of God by his willingness to sacrifice his beloved and long-awaited son. In place of Isaac, Abraham sacrifices a ram from the nearby thicket (). 

And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. 14 So Abraham called the name of that place, “The Lord will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.”

Gen 22:15–19
The Angel of Yahweh then confirms the Abrahamic covenant with the patriarch, and Abraham returns to Beersheba (). 

And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven 16 and said, “By myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, 17 I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, 18 and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.” 19 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba.

Application: If Abraham is an example of faith, what can we learn from him about the relationship between faith and obedience?
James uses Abraham’s actions as an example of how true faith works itself out in radical obedience (Jas 2:21–23). 
the NT understands Abraham and Isaac as types of God the Father and Jesus the Son. Unlike Isaac, who didn’t die, Jesus died as an atoning sacrifice for the sins of humanity. 
In Romans 8:31–32, Paul likely alludes to Gen 22 when he says, “He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, together with him, freely give us all things.

Gen 22:20–24
The chapter concludes with a genealogy of Abraham’s brother, Nahor.

Now after these things it was told to Abraham, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: 21 Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, 22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 23 (Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. 24 Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.

22 After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2 He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” 3 So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. 4 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. 5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.” 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. 7 And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” 8 Abraham said, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together. 
9 When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. 11 But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 12 He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” 13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns.

            <Text>2. God wanted to show—forever picture—that the sacrifice He wants is a spiritual and living sacrifice. God’s concern is the spiritual sacrifice of man’s body, not a human sacrifice. God wants man to offer his body as a living sacrifice. God does not want people offering their children and beautiful women to God by laying them upon altars and killing them. God wants people offering themselves and their children and beautiful women as living sacrifices to Him.
“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service” (Ro. 12:1).

3. God wanted to show—forever picture—the sacrifice of Christ at Calvary, the sacrifice of God’s very own Son for the sins of the world. There are many similarities between the offering of Abraham’s son, Isaac, and the offering of God’s Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. The similarities will be covered below. (See note, pt. 3, Thought 1—Ge. 22:11–14 for discussion.)

4. God wanted to show—forever picture—that He does test people; He tests them to show the world that some persons do fear God. By fear is meant reverence, love, awe, and true worship—all that true religion is. This was the very reason God gave for testing Abraham: verse one says that God tested Abraham and verse twelve tells why God tested him, to show that Abraham feared (reverenced, loved) God above all else, even above his very own son. This fact is discussed in more detail below (see note—Ge. 22:1–2 for more discussion).

 This is the subject of this great passage: Abraham Sacrificed Isaac: Supreme, Sacrificial Faith—the Steps to Absolute Surrender, 22:1–24.
1.	Step 1: facing God’s demand for absolute sacrifice, His highest demand (vv. 1–2).
2.	Step 2: thinking through the sacrifice (vv. 3–4).
3.	Step 3: trusting God and His power to raise up and use the sacrifice (vv. 5–8).
4.	Step 4: following through with the sacrifice (vv. 9–10).
5.	Step 5: experiencing God’s acceptance and provision (vv. 11–14).
6.	Step 6: having God’s promises renewed to one’s heart (vv. 15–18).
7.	Conclusion: receiving good news (vv. 19–24).
(Please note: a person may wish to divide this passage into two or three messages or lessons. If so, the following is suggested:
⇒	Part 1 could cover just point 1 of the outline, vv. 1–2.
⇒	Part 2 could cover points 2–4 of the outline, vv. 3–10.
⇒	Part 3 could cover points 5–6, vv. 11–24.
Of course, other divisions are possible, as well as the teaching of the passage as a whole. May our wonderful Lord help us share with power the great truths pictured so graphically in this most startling passage.) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).

1 (22:1–2) Testing—Surrender—Dedication—Sacrifice—Religions, False—Human Sacrifice: step one to absolute surrender is facing God’s demand for absolute sacrifice, His supreme highest demand.
a. God tested Abraham, put him in a severe crisis. Remember, this was not the only major test or crisis Abraham had to face (see Deeper Study # 1—Ge. 22:1–2 for more discussion). J. Vernon McGee says this:
This is a real crisis in Abraham’s life. God has brought this man through four very definite crises, each of which was a real exercise of his soul, a real strain upon his heart.
⇒	First of all, he was called to leave all of his relatives in Ur of the Chaldees. He was just to leave the whole group. That was a real test for Abraham. He didn’t do it very well at the beginning, but, nevertheless, the break finally came.
⇒	Then there was the test that came with Lot, his nephew. Abraham loved Lot—he wouldn’t have been carrying Lot around with him if he hadn’t. But the time came when they had to separate, and Lot went down to Sodom.
⇒	Then there was the test with this boy of his, the son of Hagar, Ishmael. Abraham just cried out to God, “Oh, that Ishmael might live before Thee!” He loved that boy; he hated to be separated from him.
⇒	Now Abraham comes to this supreme test, the fourth great crisis in his life: he is asked to give up Isaac. Abraham does not quite understand all the details for the very simple reason that God has told him, ‘In Isaac your seed shall be called.’ Abraham believed God would raise Isaac from the dead (see He. 11:19), but as far as Abraham is concerned, he is willing to go through with the sacrifice.
b. God asked Abraham to do a most difficult thing: to offer his son as a sacrifice to God, the son whom he loved ever so dearly. Note how God stressed Abraham’s love for his son: take your son, whom you love, and offer him as a sacrifice. Abraham was given Isaac in his old age (Ge. 21:2, 5). He had been hoping for the promised son for decades, and he had all his dreams wrapped up in him. Why would God demand such a thing from Abraham?
Very simply, God was putting Abraham to the supreme test of life, the absolute sacrifice and surrender of himself to God. Step by step God led him to the point of absolute surrender. How?
1)	God led Abraham to absolute surrender by taking the most precious thing in his life and leading him to surrender that thing as an offering, as a sacrifice to God. It was Abraham’s heart, his willingness, his spiritual surrender that God was after, not Isaac’s life. (See the passages forbidding human sacrifice—Le. 18:21; 20:1–5; De. 12:31; 18:10.)
2)	God led Abraham to absolute surrender by testing him within his environment. God always has to use the language and the things of a man’s environment if He wishes His message to be communicated and understood. In Abraham’s day the sacrifice of human beings was the supreme act of worship by some heathen religions, for example Canaanite religions. A worshipper who offered his own flesh and blood was thought to be offering the supreme sacrifice. He was proving that he loved his god supremely, above all else.
When God told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, Abraham knew exactly what God was saying to him. He was to make the supreme sacrifice, prove that he loved the only true and living God above all else. Abraham knew that God was after the absolute surrender of his heart, his will, his spirit. Verse five compared with He. 11:19 shows this (see note below—Ge. 22:5–8).
Thought 1. God did not test Abraham that Abraham might prove himself to God. God knew Abraham’s heart. God knows all things. But Abraham needed to know his own heart, and all future believers needed a picture of what absolute surrender to God means, a testimony that man can love God supremely. Man can make an absolute surrender and sacrifice of himself to God (all he is and has), and God can take care of him, no matter what may confront him. Thus the testing of Abraham took place in order to show and teach several things to both Abraham and succeeding generations.
(1)	Abraham demonstrated that a person can know God personally. A person can actually have a personal relationship with God. This is shown by the name used for God (Ha ‘Elohim) (v. 1). The Hebrew name here stresses the personal, true God. It was the personal, true God (Ha ‘Elohim) who spoke to Abraham, not just God (Elohim, the general name used for God).
“Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup [fellowship] with him, and he with me” (Re. 3:20).
“But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name” (Jn. 1:12).
(2)	Abraham demonstrated that a person can love God supremely. A person can love God before all else, even before his son or daughter (Ge. 22:2, 10). (See outline and notes—Mt. 10:35–37 for more information.)
“He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me” (Mt. 10:37).
“Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind” (Mt. 22:37).
(3)	Abraham demonstrated that a person can glorify God above all else. A person can glorify God by obeying God’s Word just as it is given, no matter the cost (Ge. 22:2, 10).
“Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven” (Mt. 7:21) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 134–135). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

(4)	Abraham demonstrated that a person can reach an unusual height of spiritual maturity, a maturity that stands out as a great testimony for God (Ge. 22:2, 5, 7–8, 10–11, 13–14).
“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Mt. 5:16).
“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect” (Mt. 5:48).
“And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Lu. 9:23).
“But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth” (Ac. 1:8).
“And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth. For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard” (Ac. 22:14–15).
“Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me” (Is. 43:10).
(5)	Abraham demonstrated that a person can be completely surrendered to God. A person can give back to God the greatest gift of all, the very gift that God had given the person in the first place, his body and his life (Ge. 22:1–2, 9–10). A person can make the absolute sacrifice of himself to God (Ge. 22:1f). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 135). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


(6)	Abraham demonstrated that a person’s faith can be victorious over all, no matter the trial (Ge. 22:1f).
“Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place” (2 Co. 2:14).
“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?” (1 Jn. 5:4–5).
(7)	Abraham demonstrated that a person can put God first, before all else, no matter the cost (Ge. 22:1–2, 9–10). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 135). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

2 (22:3–4) Sacrifice—Thinking—Trials: step two to absolute surrender is thinking through the sacrifice. God’s instructions had pierced Abraham’s heart, cut him to the core. He was hurting within, suffering the most severe pain imaginable. His thoughts were bound to be bouncing around wondering, questioning:
⇒	How could God tell me to offer my son as a sacrifice?
⇒	Is this not against God’s law that forbids murder (Ge. 9:5–6)?
⇒	How can I sacrifice my own son, the son of my heart and of my life? Would I not rather die myself than him?
⇒	Why would God want such a thing? Why, O God, why?
⇒	What about the promise? God, you promised and gave Your Word that Isaac was the promised son, that he was to be the father of nations, that through his descendents the promised seed would come, the Savior of the World? If I sacrifice Isaac, how can all this happen? How can you fulfill your promise?
⇒	How can I ever face Sarah again, or for that matter, face anyone?
⇒	And what about my testimony before the world? What are the unbelievers going to think—all those who know me, all the Canaanites, Egyptians, Philistines, and others? What kind of testimony will this be to them?
⇒	God, sacrificing Isaac does not match your promise. I cannot reconcile all this in my mind. How can you fulfill your promise if I do this thing? How could you ask me to sacrifice Isaac? What do you mean? What are you after? What are you doing?
On and on, the rampaging thoughts and questions must have flooded Abraham’s mind. But note: his questions—his inability to resolve the problem—did not keep Abraham from obeying God. Abraham obeyed God. He did not understand; nevertheless, he set about doing exactly what God had told him to do. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 135–136). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. The sacrifice of our lives to God—making an absolute surrender—demands thought, the deepest and most serious thought possible. Any person who hears God’s call to absolute surrender—to sacrifice his life totally to God—must know what he is doing. He must think through God’s call, just what it means to totally sacrifice his life to God; what it means to give up his life, to make an absolute surrender to God.
“And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Lu. 9:23).
“Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all” (1 Ti. 4:15).
“Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer” (Ps. 19:14).
“O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!” (De. 32:29).

3 (22:5–8) Trust—Faith—God, Power—Resurrection: step three to absolute surrender is trusting God, His power to raise up and use the sacrifice. Abraham trusted God, trusted every Word that God had said.
a. Abraham believed that God would raise up Isaac from the dead, if need be (v. 5). An astonishing belief; nevertheless, it is exactly what Scripture says. Note verse five: Abraham instructed the servants to wait at the bottom of the mountain while he and Isaac went to the top and worshipped. He then said that both he and Isaac would return. Abraham was not lying to the men; he actually believed they both would return. Hebrews tells us what Abraham was thinking: God would raise Isaac from the dead, if need be (He. 11:17–19).
The point is this: Abraham knew that God’s Word—His promise—was true: his son would live and give rise to nations of people and to the promised seed, the Savior of the world. Therefore, God would raise Isaac from the dead, if need be, to fulfill His promise. Abraham’s trust in God had grown so much that he actually believed that God would resurrect Isaac. He was learning—really learning—what total surrender meant. Abraham was casting himself completely upon God.
Keep in mind, Abraham had never seen any person raised from the dead. But the thought crossed his mind, and he gave great thought to the idea. He believed that God would raise Isaac in order to fulfill His promise. What faith! What great belief in God and His promises, in God and His power! Note how Abraham was surrendering to God all the way through this experience. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 136). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. What is it that stirs us to sacrifice our lives to God, to make an absolute surrender to Him? Trust, believing that God has the power to raise us up and use us. And God does: He does have the power to take our lives, raise them up, and use them for good throughout the whole world. We must, therefore, trust God and sacrifice our lives in absolute surrender to Him—for the sake of the world, the needy and lost of the world.
“Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!” (Ps. 31:19).

4 (22:9–10) Sacrifice—Surrender: step four to absolute surrender is following through with the sacrifice. This is the most important step in sacrificing one’s life to God, in making the absolute surrender to God. It had been three days since God had instructed Abraham to make the supreme sacrifice, to offer his own son as a sacrifice to God. Abraham had three long days to agonize over the matter. For three days—days that had passed far too quickly—Abraham had taken weary step after weary step, with a heart so heavy that he must have felt as though it would burst. Now, father and son had reached the fatal place. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 137). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. Have you offered up your life as a sacrifice to God? Have you made the absolute surrender of your life to God? Have I?
⇒	Do we love God more than anything?
⇒	Are we willing to sacrifice ourselves totally for God and His cause?
⇒	Are we willing to sacrifice everything for God—to actually give God everything—our lives and our possessions?
⇒	Again, are we willing to sacrifice everything for God—all our possessions—in order to take the gospel of God’s Son to the uttermost part of the earth?
⇒	Are we willing to obey God totally, no matter the cost?
⇒	Are we totally surrendered—absolutely surrendered—to God?
Abraham was; we must be. We must give ourselves totally to God. We must give all that we possess—everything—to get the Word of God out to the whole world.
“And he said to [them] all, If any [man] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Lu. 9:23).
“For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?” (Lu. 9:24–25).
“For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it” (Mt. 16:25).
“Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee” (Mk. 10:28).
“If any [man] come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple” (Lu. 14:26–27).
“So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple” (Lu. 14:33).
“And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting” (Lu. 18:29–30).
Thought 2. Matthew Henry has a graphic description of this event: Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 137–138). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

5 (22:11–14) Acceptance: step five to absolute surrender is experiencing God’s acceptance and provision. Now comes the great joy of sacrificing everything to God.
a. God accepted the sacrifice and surrender of Abraham’s heart. He called out to stop Abraham from sacrificing Isaac. When Abraham reached out and took the knife to slay his son, God knew that Abraham was totally surrendered to Him. God knew that Abraham’s heart belonged to Him—totally and absolutely. Nothing, absolutely nothing, stood between Abraham and God. Abraham would sacrifice anything and do anything for God. Abraham would obey God, no matter the sacrifice or cost. God was the most precious person and the most treasured thing in Abraham’s life.
Note that God acknowledged this. He knew …
•	that Abraham feared God—reverenced and trusted God—above all else (v. 12)
•	that Abraham loved God more than his own son (v. 12)
Within his heart, Abraham had offered the supreme sacrifice to God. Within his heart, Abraham had made the absolute surrender of himself to God.
The point is this: God is after the hearts of people, the surrender of their spirits to Him, not the slaying of their bodies.
⇒	God wants living sacrifices, not dead sacrifices.
⇒	God wants the bodies of people, but He wants living bodies, not dead bodies.
⇒	God wants a human sacrifice, but He wants the sacrifices living, not dead.
God wants people to sacrifice their lives—their hearts, spirits, and bodies—to Him. He wants people to surrender themselves—totally and absolutely, but He wants them living, not dead. God accepts a living sacrifice, not a dead one Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 138). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Thought 1. God accepted the sacrifice of Abraham’s heart. It is always the willingness, the surrender of the heart that makes the offering of a sacrifice acceptable to God. God is after the heart, not the sacrifice. Our hearts must reach out to God before we lay a sacrifice before God.
“And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams” (1 S. 15:22).
“For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise” (Ps. 51:16–17).
“To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice” (Pr. 21:3). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 139). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Thought 1. Abraham’s offering his son Isaac is a picture of God offering His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, as a sacrifice for man. The sacrifice of Isaac is a type—a symbol, a picture, a prophecy—of the sacrifice of Christ at Calvary, the sacrifice of God’s very own Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, for the sins of the world.
⇒	Abraham was asked to give up his most cherished possession to God; God has given up His most cherished possession to man (vv. 1–2).
⇒	Abraham was asked to sacrifice his own son for God; God has sacrificed His only Son for man (v. 2, see Jn. 3:16; Ro. 8:32).
⇒	Abraham believed that God would raise up his son, if need be; God did raise up His own Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Note: it can even be said that Isaac was as good as dead (sacrificed) in the heart of Abraham during the three days of traveling before the resurrection. The resurrection of both Isaac and Christ took place three days after their death (v. 5).
⇒	Isaac was apparently willing to obey God and be sacrificed, for there is no evidence of a struggle. Isaac was obedient to death even as Christ was obedient to death (Ph. 2:5–8).
⇒	The ram was provided as a substitute for Isaac; the lamb of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, was provided as a substitute for all mankind (v. 13, see Jn. 1:29; Is. 53:5–7).
⇒	Isaac carried the wood upon which he was to be laid as a sacrifice; Christ carried the cross upon which He was to be hung as the sacrifice for the sins of the world (v. 6).
⇒	Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice upon Mt. Moriah, the very mountain upon which Jerusalem was built (2 Chr. 3:1); God offered up Christ on Calvary, right outside Jerusalem, upon the very same mountain ridge or range where Isaac was offered (v. 2). (Note: this tells us why God had Abraham travel three days to offer Isaac on Mt. Moriah. The offering of Isaac was planned by God to be a type of God’s offering of Christ.
⇒	Abraham called Mt. Moriah Jehovah-Jireh, “the Lord will provide.” God provided a substitutionary sacrifice for Abraham; God has provided a substitutionary sacrifice for us in the Lord Jesus Christ (vv. 13–14).
⇒	Isaac was to bear the consuming fire of Abraham; Jesus Christ has borne the consuming fire of God’s holiness and judgment against sin (the Bible often uses fire to symbolize the holiness and judgment of God) (v. 6).
⇒	Abraham received the great joy of God’s promise because he willingly sacrificed his will to God’s will; Jesus Christ is to experience the fulfillment of His joy because He totally surrendered His will to God’s will and sacrificed Himself for the sins of the world (vv. 15–18, see He. 12:2).

            <Title>Testing</Title>
            <Text>4. God wanted to show—forever picture—that He does test people; He tests them to show the world that some persons do fear God. By fear is meant reverence, love, awe, and true worship—all that true religion is. This was the very reason God gave for testing Abraham: verse one says that God tested Abraham and verse twelve tells why God tested him, to show that Abraham feared (reverenced, loved) God above all else, even above his very own son. This fact is discussed in more detail below (see note—Ge. 22:1–2 for more discussion).



Deeper Study # 1
(22:1–2) Testing—Crises: the life of Abraham gives an excellent study on the tests or crises of life. It is important to note that every crisis and problem in human life is not a test from God. We often bring crises upon ourselves because of our sin and disobedience to God. But there are times when God does test us, and we need to understand this fact.
1. Note how God tests a person.
a.	God tests a person by initiating the test Himself, as in this case with Abraham offering Isaac as a sacrifice.
b.	God tests a person by allowing the crisis to arise from natural or human events. Examples of this are seen in point three of this note.
c.	In some cases, God allows Satan to create a crisis that tests the faith and loyalty of believers. The book of Job shows this.
2. Now note why God tests believers (see note 1–1 Pe. 4:12 for more discussion; also see Master Subject Index, Test—Testing, The Purpose of Testing).
a.	God tests believers to make them stronger. When a person endures and conquers a crisis, he is inwardly stronger than ever before. He is far more able to conquer crises in the future.
“Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day” (2 Co. 4:16).
“And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me” (2 Co. 12:9).
b.	God tests believers to make them look forward to heaven more. Crises, especially severe crises of suffering, pain, and grief, make us long far more for heaven.
“For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal” (2 Co. 4:17–18).
“By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went. By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God” (He. 11:8–10).
“These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city” (He. 11:13–16).
“And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away” (Re. 21:4).
c.	God tests believers to make them a greater witness to those around them. When a person endures and conquers a crisis, he is a testimony to others, a living example that a person can overcome the crises of this life.
“Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God” (2 Co. 1:3–4).
3. Note the tests that Abraham had to face throughout his life. He had to face crisis after crisis—major tests—all throughout his life, far more than the average person has to face. Abraham stands as a dynamic example in showing us how to conquer crisis after crisis. He conquered them all through the faith and power of God.
a.	There was the crisis of God’s call to separation. When God called Abraham to leave Ur of the Chaldees, he had to separate from his country and relatives, and from his father’s house, its possessions and property. He had to separate from all he had ever known. At first, Abraham showed weakness in accepting God’s call, but he finally passed the test and committed his life to God. (See outline and notes—Ge. 12:4–9.)
b.	There was the crisis of hunger and famine and of losing his business holdings. In fact, Abraham faced the loss of all he had. Abraham failed this test. He forsook the promised land and went down into Egypt (a symbol of the world and a life of worldliness) (see outline and notes—Ge. 12:10–13:4).
c.	There was the crisis of Lot’s separation from Abraham. This separation was due to the materialistic and greedy nature of Lot. Abraham must have suffered unbearable pain when Lot chose the best ranch land and left the second best for Abraham. Abraham loved Lot like a son; therefore, he suffered excruciating pain when Lot forsook God to choose the world over God (see outline and notes—Ge. 13:5–18).
d.	There was the crisis of the invading army from the East. Dealing with this crisis required great courage. The invaders captured all the citizens of the surrounding cities, including Lot. Not only was Abraham about to lose Lot, he was about to lose the markets for his business enterprises. All he had was again being threatened. Abraham met the crisis head-on and demonstrated unusual courage in defeating the invaders and in freeing the captives (see outline and notes—Ge. 14:1–16).
e.	There was the crisis of seeking worldly honor, power, position, and riches. When Abraham defeated the invading armies, he could have become the ruler over much of the land, but he refused to run ahead of God and to use worldly methods to secure the promised land. Abraham passed this test (see outline and notes—Ge. 14:17–24).
f.	There was the crisis of not having a son, of having to be patient enough to wait upon God and His timing for sending the promised son. This crisis required patience and belief. Abraham failed in this test and married Hagar and bore Ishmael (see outline and notes—Ge. 16:1–16).
g.	There was the crisis of God’s judgment and emotional security. This was the crisis of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities. Their destruction left a devastation of the area that must have been horrible to look upon and emotionally disturbing (see Ge. 20:1–2). Moreover, their destruction meant a crisis for Abraham’s business dealings: the major markets for his herds and other dealings were gone (see outline and notes—Ge. 19:1–38).
h.	There was the crisis of again facing the loss of all he had. Abraham again forsook the promised land and went down to the capital of the Philistines in search of markets for his herds and business affairs (see outline and notes—Ge. 20:1–18).
i.	There was the crisis of being separated and divorced from his loved ones. This was the crisis of having to send Hagar and his son Ishmael away. This meant that he would be separated forever from Hagar and his son Ishmael whom he loved ever so dearly (see outline and notes—Ge. 21:8–21).
j.	There was the supreme crisis of offering Isaac as a sacrifice to God. This required total commitment to God, being willing to sacrifice everything for God (see outline and notes—Ge. 22:1–24).
Thought 1. Warren Wiersbe has given descriptive titles to the tests Abraham faced during his life. His commentary on the tests should be of real help as we face the trials and temptations of life.
In the “School of Faith” we must have occasional tests, or we will never know where we are spiritually. Abraham had his share of tests right from the beginning. First was the “family test,” when he had to leave his loved ones and step out by faith to go to a new land (Ge. 11:27–12:5). This was followed by the ‘famine test,’ which Abraham failed because he doubted God and went down to Egypt for help (12:10–13:4).
Once back in the land, Abraham passed the “fellowship test” when he gave Lot first choice in using the pastureland (13:5–18). He also passed the “fight test” when he defeated the kings (14:1–16) and the ‘fortune test’ when he said no to Sodom’s wealth (14:17–24). But he failed the ‘fatherhood test’ when Sarah got impatient with God and suggested that Abraham have a child by Hagar (Ge. 16). When the time came to send Ishmael away, Abraham passed the “farewell test” even though it broke his heart (21:14–21).
Not every difficult experience in life is necessarily a personal test from God. (Of course, any experience could become a test or a temptation, depending on how we deal with it. See James 1:12–16.) Sometimes our own disobedience causes the pain or disappointment, as when Abraham went to Egypt (Ge. 12:10ff) and to Gerar (Ge. 20). Sometimes our hurts are simply a part of normal human life: As we grow older, friends and loved ones relocate or even die, life changes around us, and we must make painful adjustments.
Learn to distinguish between trials and temptations. Temptations come from our desires within us (James 1:12–16) while trials come from the Lord who has a special purpose to fulfill. Temptations are used by the devil to bring out the worst in us, but trials are used by the Holy Spirit to bring out the best in us ([James] 1:1–6). Temptations seem logical while trials seem very unreasonable. Why would God give Abraham a son and then ask Abraham to kill him?
All believers face similar temptations to sin (1 Co. 10:13), but not all believers experience the same trials of faith. God’s testings are tailor-made for each child of God, and each experience is unique. God never asked Lot to face the tests that Abraham faced. Why? Because Lot was being tempted by the world and the flesh and never grew to the place of maturity that Abraham reached. In one sense, it is a compliment when God sends us a test; it shows God wants to “promote us” in the “School of Faith.” God never sends a test until He knows you are ready for it.
“Life is difficult,” wrote psychiatrist M. Scott Peck. “Once we truly know that life is difficult—once we truly understand and accept it—then life is no longer difficult.” That is the first lesson we must learn: Expect trials from God, because the Christian life is not easy.6 Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

 (nāsâ). vb. test, try, tempt, put one to the test. Describes God putting people to the test or people testing God.

The verb nāsâ can be used to describe the act of God testing individuals and groups, such as Abraham (Gen 22:1), Israel (in both the wilderness and the promised land; e.g., Exod 15:25; 16:4; Deut 8:2; Judg 3:4), the tribe of Levi (Deut 33:8), Hezekiah (2 Chr 32:31), and a psalmist (Psa 26:2). 

God’s testing has particular purposes: 
to prevent people from sinning (Exod 20:20b); 
to see whether they will follow God’s instructions (Exod 16:4); 
to discover the motives of the heart and to keep his commandments (Deut 8:2; 2 Chr 32:31); 
to do good in the end to those he tests (Deut 8:16); 
and to see whether they love him wholeheartedly (Deut 13:4) and whether they will obey the his way (Judg 2:22; 3:4). 

The verb nāsâ also refers on several occasions to Israel putting God to the test during the wilderness journey (e.g., Exod 17:7; Num 14:22; Deut 6:16; Psa 78:18; 95:9). It is used once to describe the occasion of Ahaz testing God (Isa 7:12).

 The verb nāsâ can also be used in the sense of testing the feasibility of some actions or matters (Deut 4:34; 28:56; Judg 6:39; 1 Sam 17:39; Eccl 7:23). Kim, S. H. (2014). Testing. D. Mangum, D. R.

            <Title>&quot;Testing&quot;</Title>
            <Text>The Hebrew word for “test” is “nasah”, which also carries the sense “to prove” (BDB Hebrew-English Lexicon, p. 650). When applied to God as the subject, testing takes on positive purposes. For instance, God often tests His children in order to make us more mature and to developer character (James 1:2-4). God also tests us in order to help us to develop an eternal perspective (2 Corinthians 4:17-18). In addition, the apostle Peter wrote that the testing of our faith proves its authenticity (1 Peter 1:6-7). Just as God did with Israel in the wilderness, testing also has the purpose of proving our love for and obedience to the Lord (Exodus 16:4). As Israel repeatedly did, we can negatively test God’s faithfulness through a lack of trust. The classic example of this can be found in Israel’s response to the spies’ report in Numbers 14:1-12.
We are told in James 1:2-4 that we should expect to trials of various kinds to test our faith. Quite often, the trials we experience will come through people. At other times the trials may be comprised of difficult circumstances, such as financial hardship. Scripture also teaches us that trials may come through satanic opposition. Job serves as the classic example of one who suffered at the hands of the devil. Just as with Peter, the enemy of our souls desires to sift us as wheat, with the end goal of us abandoning our faith (Luke 22:31). He will often use persecutions to achieve this goal (Revelation 2:10).</Text>

            <Title>Abraham's Response</Title>
            <Text>When confronted with God’s test to sacrifice Isaac, Abraham acts in obedience: “So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him” (Genesis 22:3). Abraham likely tossed several questions in his mind: “How could God command me to sacrifice my promised son? Isn’t it against the Lord’s way to sacrifice humans? How will I be able to explain this to Sarah? Is this really the voice of the Lord?” Whatever doubts or complaints he may have had, they did not prevent Abraham from obeying God. Through his actions, Abraham proved that his faith had reached  the level of sacrificial obedience.
We must keep in mind that lip service does not demonstrate the reality of a person’s faith in Jesus. The Lord warned “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven” (Matthew 7:21). In addition, merely holding on to right beliefs without a changed life puts one on par with the demons (James 2:14-26). Faith demands radical obedience. The Lord calls us to give Him our very lives - to be totally surrendered to the Lord and His purposes. The Lord puts it this way: “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me” (Mark 8:34). Following the Lord faithfully demands that we give up our agenda for the Lord’s agenda.
As Abraham and Isaac drew near to their final destination, the extent of Abraham’s faith comes to light. Isaac takes inventory of the sacrifice materials and asks him about the lamb for the burnt offering. It’s missing! Abraham confidently responded, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son” (Genesis 22:8). What an astonishing response! We have every reason to accept that Abraham truly believed that God would provide an offering. He was not lying, for according to the Hebrews writer “He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back” (11:19). Abraham had reached the point in his faith that he absolutely believed in the all-powerful faithfulness of the Lord. 
Christian friend, do you believe that the Lord has the power to raise you up and use you to accomplish His will? Have you offered yourself as a living sacrifice to God? Are you willing to obey God even if it cost you prestige, money and possessions? Our life motto should be “to live is Christ and to die is gain” rather than “to live is to have power, comfort, riches, or approval and to die is horrible.” This is what we see in Abraham’s example of faith.

            <Text>I Never Knew You
21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ 23 And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Mt 7:21–23). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.

34 And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. 35 For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it. 36 For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul? 37 For what can a man give in return for his soul? 38 For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Mk 8:34–38). Wheaton: Standard Bible Society.

17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son, 18 of whom it was said, “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” 19 He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back. 20 By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau. 21 By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff. 22 By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.

            <Title>The Divine Verdict</Title>
            <Text>The altar has been built and Isaac has been bound to it. When Abraham lifted the knife to kill his son, the angel of the Lord stopped him saying, “‘Abraham, Abraham!’ And he said, ‘Here I am.’ He said, ‘Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me’” (Genesis 22:11-12). God declared what He already foreknew - that Abraham loved the giver more than the gift. His love for the Lord was evident in his willingness to hold nothing back. For his own sake, Abraham now knew the true extent of his faith in God. He proved that he truly feared God by his willingness to sacrifice his beloved and long-awaited son! Like Abraham, God is after the complete surrender of our hearts and lives to Him. The conditions of our faith walk with the Lord requires that we love the Lord more than anything or anyone else (Matthew 10:37-39).

            <Title>Following God's Promise</Title>
            <Text>The success of this final test was recognized by another pronouncement of God’s covenant promises for Abraham. God reaffirmed His promise to bless Abraham with descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and to bless the entire world through Abraham’s offspring. Just as it began, the story of Abraham ends with this promise of worldwide blessing (Gen 12:3; 22:18).

God’s initial promise to Abraham appeared unconditional. Nothing was required of Abraham for him to receive this blessing. However, over the course of multiple reiterations of the promise, God established that Abraham’s faithful obedience was a condition of his continued blessing. The test to sacrifice Isaac was the final proof of Abraham’s commitment to cling to God’s voice and follow His promise, no matter where it led or what it required (Gen 22:18). Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 21:1–22:24). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

Study Questions
1.	Have you ever experienced a time when you were more focused on what God had provided for you in the past than on what He might have planned for you in the future?

2.	Reflect on a time when you felt your faith was being tested. What made it difficult or easy for you to believe? Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 21:1–22:24). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

Throughout the Bible
Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac represents the highest expression of his faith in Genesis. The authors of the nt similarly recognized this event as a preeminent example of faithfully responding to God. The author of Hebrews emphasizes how Abraham serves as an example for believers, writing, “the one who received the promises was ready to offer his one and only son” (Heb 11:17). The very tension we identified earlier is present here: While God’s command to sacrifice Isaac seemed to jeopardize God’s promise to him, Abraham “was ready.” His example encourages us to “run with patient endurance the race that has been set before us” (Heb 12:1). Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 21:1–22:24). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.


The authors of the nt also believed Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac foreshadowed the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. Hebrews describes Isaac as Abraham’s “one and only son” (Heb 11:17). The Greek term here, monogenēs, is used most often in the nt to describe Jesus, God’s only begotten Son (see John 1:14; 3:16). Paul also describes God’s sending of Christ to redeem humanity as “He did not spare His own Son” (Rom 8:32), phrasing that echoes God’s words to Abraham in Gen 22:16.
While the sacrifice of Isaac came to be understood as foreshadowing Christ’s sacrifice, there was one major difference: Isaac was spared, whereas Christ was sacrificed. Abraham was willing to sacrifice his only son, but God intervened and provided a substitute for Isaac in the form of the ram (Gen 22:13). God loves us enough that He did not spare His only Son; instead, Christ took our place as our substitute. And through the sacrifice of Christ, we have become heirs of the promise God first gave to Abraham and fulfilled through the redemption of Christ (Rom 8:17).
Study Questions
1.	Read James 2:14–26 and Rom 4:1–25. How do you understand the interplay of faith and works as explained by James and Paul? What relevance does this have in your life?

2.	In what ways does Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac remind you of Christ’s sacrifice? In what ways are these sacrifices different? Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 21:1–22:24). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

Study Questions
1.	Can you think of a time when God called on you to exhibit extreme faith? How did you do it, and what was the result?

2.	Think of an instance where you witnessed God’s deliverance in the midst of a struggle or trial. How did He deliver, and what did you learn about His character?
 Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 21:1–22:24). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

Application
Abraham’s life is bracketed by examples of extreme faith. In Genesis 12:1, God told him to go to a foreign land, and in Gen 12:4, he obeyed without question. He left all he knew for the sake of obtaining God’s promise. In Genesis 22, after he finally received the promised son, Abraham was commanded to give Isaac up as a burnt offering. Despite the apparent absurdity of the request, Abraham complied without ever questioning God. He was confident that both he and Isaac would return—whether by resurrection or some other form of deliverance (see Heb 11:19). Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 21:1–22:24). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

Despite his failures along the way, Abraham is remembered for these two successes—particularly his unflinching faith in Gen 22. After walking with God for 25 years, Abraham knew God could be trusted. Sacrificing Isaac wasn’t the first seemingly “crazy” thing God asked him to do. God had commanded Abraham to leave the comforts of home and spend his life sojourning in tents; He had instructed him to travel with his family among potentially hostile enemies; He had ordered him to circumcise himself as a sign of His covenant of “blessing”; He had directed him to cast out his true firstborn son, Ishmael; and He had told him to conceive a child at the age of 100. Yet Abraham trusted God’s purposes through all these things and, in Gen 22, he complied without hesitation with God’s most shocking demand yet.
Not only was God’s reputation for keeping His covenant at stake—He would have to undergo something similar in the future. Approximately 2,000 years later, in a situation that mirrored Abraham’s, God offered His own Son as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity. This connection is what makes Gen 22 so real for us. Abraham could have looked for an easy way out just as he did earlier in his life, but he didn’t. He had come to know God’s power and trusted Him to fulfill His promises. Grigoni, M. R., Custis, M., Mangum, D., &amp; Whitehead, M. M. (2012). Abraham: Following God’s Promise (Ge 21:1–22:24). Bellingham, WA: Lexham Press.

God commands us to trust in the sacrifice of His Son, and this can sometimes be difficult. There are certainly easier ways to get through life—ways that will allow for the kind of compromise and dishonesty that we observed earlier in Abraham’s story. But none of these will get us where God wants us to be: with Him for eternity. Walter Brueggemann, a theologian and Bible commentator, summed up the situation well:
The testing times for Israel and for all of us who are heirs of Abraham are those times when it is seductively attractive to find an easier, less demanding alternative to God. The testings which come in history (and which are from God) drive us to find out whether we mean what we say about our faith being grounded solely in the gospel.
Following God is difficult, but Abraham knew he could trust God no matter what kind of test emerged. The same is true for us today. When our commitment is tested, we can look to examples like Abraham for the courage to persevere (see Rom 15:4; 1 Cor 10:11; Heb 12:1–3). The same God who provided for Abraham in his most desperate hour (see Gen 22:13) also makes deliverance possible for us (see John 3:16–17). As true children of Abraham—followers of God characterized by faith—we can demonstrate our devotion by an extreme faith in God’s promises and sacrifice.
