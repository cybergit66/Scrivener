            <Text>In less than ten generations after God commanded Noah and his sons to “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” (Ge. 9:3, ESV), mankind had rebelled against God’s mandate and decided to build a world order apart from God’s guidance. It was this type of self-determination which lead the first family (Adam and Eve) to sin against God and plunged humanity into a cesspool of violence and immorality (Ge. 6:1-6). Humanity’s state of being and the conditions on earth grieved the Lord. In an act of judgment and mercy, God sent the Great Flood to destroy mankind, but he spared Noah and his family. This time, God’s reaction to mankind’s rebellion culminating at the Tower of Babel consisted of God dividing the world into nations. Through the lineage of Shem, God will initiate the next phase in His plan to crush the head of the Serpent by choosing one man to be his instrument to bless the world - Abraham.
In Genesis 11:27-32, we learn that Abramham’s family originated in Ur of the Chaldeans. Scholars debate the precise identification of Ur, but most accept modern Tell el-Muqayyar in southern Iraq as the location. Lead by his father Terah, Abraham migrated with his family from Ur to Haran after the death of his brother Haran. Both Ur and Haran were ancient centers for the worship of the moon god Sin - we learn from Joshua 24:2 that Abraham’s family worshipped pagan deities. While living in Haran, Terah died and apparently Abraham (then known as Abram)assumed leadership of the clan which included his barren wife Sarai and his nephew Lot. </Text>

About This Template
When compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in standard manuscript format with sub-headings inside the chapters.

How To Use This Template
Edit the Title Page document to ensure it contains the correct information.
Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, as chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter Subtitle”.
Create a new text document for each sub-section within the chapter folders, giving each the title of the subheading you wish to appear in the text. You can nest text documents for smaller subheadings, like this:
￼
If you don’t require a foreword, move the “Foreword” document to the Trash folder. Alternatively, rename it “Preface” or “Introduction” if you prefer. If you would rather the foreword come after the table of contents—as is sometimes the case—drag the “Foreword” document and drop it below the “Contents” document.
If you are compiling to the RTF file format or if you have Microsoft Office installed and are compiling to DOC, DOCX, PDF or Print, you can create a table of contents. Before compiling, simply select all the documents you wish to be included in the contents listing (usually this will be the “Foreword”, all chapter folders, and “Endnotes”, but not the nested sub-sections), then go to Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as ToC. Paste into the “Contents” document below the “Contents” title. The resulting linked text and page number tags will be replaced with the final chapter names and page numbers in the compiled document. You can format the contents however you wish, for example removing the underlines or indenting subsections if you chose to include them. You don’t need to do this every time you compile, just when chapters have been added, deleted, renamed or moved around. (Note to Microsoft Word users: If you export to Word, you may need to generate a print preview in Word to force the page numbers to show up correctly—they may appear as question marks before doing so.) Deselect “Include in compile” for the Contents document in the inspector if you do not want it in your final output.
If you have no footnotes or endnotes in your text, be sure to delete the “Endnotes” document.
“Notes” and “Ideas” folders have been provided for your convenience, although you can replace them or create different top-level folders for your research materials if necessary (these are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Compile your manuscript into standard manuscript format by selecting File &gt; Compile. The “Front Matter” folder is already selected for inclusion in the compile Contents pane.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include. You will also need to edit the title prefix in the “Section Layout”.
Hierarchical numbering: If you require hierarchical numbering for sub-sections, choose “Non-Fiction with Sub-Heads (Hierarchical)” from the “Format As” menu in Compile. Alternatively, edit the “Section Layout” for each level in the “Formatting” pane of Compile and add the “&lt;$hn&gt;” (for “hierarchical numbering”) tag to the title prefixes. 
Page header: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings.

Sample Document

            <Synopsis>&quot;Abram's faith was again tested by trial (Gen 13:2­7). While Abram failed the early
tests in Egypt, he acted selflessly later, allowing Lot to choose the best area of land.
The pairing of these two stories develops a fuller picture of Abram's faith journey: He
had both successes and failures when attempting to follow God's will. Together, these
stories teach us that although our faith might not be perfect, God's continued faithful-

            <Text>Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. 2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed” (Gen. 12:1-4).
God’s interactions with Abraham begins not only with a command to leave his family and homeland - but also He commands Abraham to go to a land God would show him. It should be noted that God had not provided Abraham with the details of the promised land. Abraham’s journey is very risky because his is merely pointed in the direction he should go, but given no information about his final destination. We read in Hebrews that “he went out, not knowing where he was going” (11:8b). Following God under these circumstances demanded great faith on Abraham’s part for he was dependent upon God for daily guidance, protection and sustenance. 
Furthermore, God’s promise to provide Abraham with a great nation presented a great challenge to his faith because Sarah was barren! Despite years of failing to produce children, Abraham (and Sarah) did not surrender to unbelief. Instead, they set out on a journey that will test their faith in God’s promises to the limit. Consequently, Abraham actions will have a significant impact upon humanity.</Text>

            <Title>Separation from the Past</Title>
            <Text>It’s most likely that prior to God calling him Abram was an idolater given what we read in Joshua 24:2 - “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Long ago, your fathers lived beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods.’” God’s call to Abram necessitated that he disavow any allegiance to the gods of his fathers. The call demanded that he separate himself from idolatry.
Separation from one’s past sinful life is generally known as repentance. One key Hebrew word (šûb - “turn”) expresses repentance as turning away from the wrong path, i.e., sinful behavior, and turning back toward God (DiFransico, Lexham Theological Wordbook). The same idea is found in the New Testament with the Greek word metanoeō which means “to change one’s mind”, resulting in an re-orientation of one’s life (Bauer, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, 640). Paul’s recognition of the Thessalonians conversion in 1 Thessalonians 1:9-10 highlights the nature of true repentance - “For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.” Just as God commanded Abram to leave his past behind and center his life on God’s promise, Jesus commands his followers leave behind their past way of living to serve him(Mark 1:15; Luke 13:3). 
As we will learn from the life of Abraham, repentance is not just a one-time event in the life of the Christian. Though known as the father of the faithful, Abraham suffered many faith failures. Each one proved to be a learning experience and over the course of his life Abraham’s trust in God grew. As we come to awareness of the sins and vices that hinder and keep us from experiencing the joy of the Christian life, we realize that there exist much room for spiritual growth in our lives. We must resolve, through the power of the Holy Spirit, to eliminate sinful habits and attitudes that prevent us from fully pursuing the life God intends for us to live. On the other hand, we learn to develop and pursue a lifestyle that will bring honor to God. Just as He did with Abraham, God will provide us the grace to grow in our faith!</Text>

            <Title>Cornerstone</Title>
            <Text>The account of God’s interactions with Abram begins with a call for Abram to leave his ancestral people and homeland: ‘Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you”’(Gen. 12:1, ESV). Leaving the comfort of home, family, and familiar surroundings can be quite a challenge because such a transition can remove one from the love, care, acceptance, and security of a strong support system - especially in ancient nomadic cultures. 
However, this is exactly what God demanded of Abram. The word “go” is lek-leka in Hebrew, which expresses that Abram is to “determinately dissociate himself” from his current environment (Bruce Waltke, Genesis: A commentary, 205). Hebrews 11:8 makes it clear that Abram forsook his home in obedience to God’s call. He obeyed not even knowing where he was going! He exchanged the known for the unknown, the familiar for the unfamiliar. God called Abram to a new life, but he had to leave his old life behind. Likewise, Christians have been called to a new life of discipleship which involves separation from the past life of sin, separation from the world, and possibly separation from family and friends.

            <Text>Abraham looms over Biblical history as the father of the faithful. His journey to this status began at age 75 when God called him leave his people and homeland. Abraham willingly left Haran with his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, along with their belongings and people they acquired. In doing so, Abraham demonstrated a high level of commitment to God and His promises. He demonstrated the ability to listen to God and the faith to allow God to work out the details of His plan.</Text>

        <Document ID="58">
            <Title>Cornerstone</Title>
            <Text>God’s promises to Abraham begins with the promise of land (12:1). When Abraham left Haran with Sarah, Lot and all of their possessions, they set out for the land of Canaan (12:5). When they arrived, they discovered that the territory was already inhabited by Canaanites. When Abraham arrived at Shechem the Lord appeared and reassured him - “to your offspring I will give this land” (12:7). The promised land definitely refers to Canaan, also known as Palestine, the land of Israel. In response to God’s reassurance Abraham built an altar and worshiped God. Even though people already inhabited the land, Abraham demonstrated that faith in God’s promise displays itself through actions. He reminds us that faith begins with hearing God’s word and grows as we continue to obey God’s word. A living faith leads to a life of devotion to and worship of God.
As Abraham continued to explore the land and build altars to God, we know that he was also looking forward to an eternal land, for the Scripture says “he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God”. God’s promise to Abraham included the assurance of an eternal city and homeland that transcended Canaan. He journeyed as a foreigner looking forward to the fulfillment of the same promise given to us as Christians - the promise of a new heavens and a new earth (2 Peter 3:13). We will inherit the promise of a renewed universe if we, like Abraham, respond to God in faithful obedience (Romans 4:13). Thus, the promised land not only refers to Canaan but it also is a symbol of the holy city, the New Jerusalem, that will come down out of heaven from God (Revelation 21:2).
Just imagine how the fulfillment of the promised land  would affect Abraham’s life. It would mean removal of the obstacles currently in place in Canaan. He would be able to settle down. He could avoid being exposed to different kinds of dangers, threats and attacks upon his family. In a sense, the fulfillment of the promise would bring victory and rest to Abraham., but it was not fulfilled during his lifetime. In the meantime, Abraham would have to continue to press onward trusting God’s word, guidance, and protection. As Christians, we are commanded to “strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account” (Hebrews 4:11-13).
God also promised to make Abraham’s name great (12:2). Waltke writes “in the ancient Near East, a name was not merely a label but a revelation of character. Thus a great name entails not only fame but high social esteem as a man of superior character” (A Commentary on Genesis, p. 205). God indeed did make Abraham’s name known: Melchizedek, the high priest of God at Salem recognized him as blessed by God (14); the rulers of his day recognized Abraham as a mighty prince (21:22-34; 23:6); and he was known as a prophet (20:7). Furthermore, Abraham’s name is great throughout history as the ancestral father of Jewish and Arab peoples. More importantly, the name of Abraham is synonymous with faith.  
In addition, God promised to bless and make Abraham great so that he would be a blessing to others. In other words, God promised to use Abraham to have positive impact on the world around him and beyond (12:3). As a result of his response to God’s call, Abraham blessed generations of saints with a great example of faith. The NT writers exalt Abraham as the supreme example of what it means to have a faith that God honors (Romans 4; Galatians 3; Hebrews 11:3-10; James 2:18-23). What made Abraham’s faith so great? Was it because he lived a sinless life? No. In fact, Abraham was plagued by many of the same weaknesses and sins as we are. However, Abraham believed God against the odds. He left Haran for the promised land despite not having the details of the plan or of the final destination. He continued to trust God to fulfill his God despite never possessing the land. He believed that he would become the ancestral father of a great nation despite years of unsuccessful attempts to bear children through Sarah. He believed that God would use him to bless the world through the promised Seed - the Savior -  despite his past life of idolatry and paganism.
Thus the greatest blessing to come through Abraham would be Jesus, the promised Seed through whom salvation would be available to all the world. Galatians 3:8-9 says, “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‘In you shall all the nations be blessed.’ So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.” This is the climax of God’s promises to Abraham. God’s plan of redemption begins with Abraham in Canaan. The promised seed will come through the great nation of Abraham’s loins, Israel. This promised seed, Jesus, is God’s one and only Son who gave His life to atone for the sins of the entire world (1 John 2:2). 
However, Jesus triumphed over the grave and after his resurrection He commissioned his followers to “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matthew 28:19-20). Just as God called Abraham, we have been called by God through the gospel to follow Jesus, the promised Seed. Those who respond to the gospel are heirs to the promises God made to Abraham. In turn, we are to extend this blessings to others through the teaching and preaching of the gospel. </Text>

            <Text>God’s call to leave his country and his family was paired with great promises. What made Abraham’s faith response so remarkable was that his life circumstances would have led most people to reject God’s call. Furthermore, many of the promises were never fully realized during his lifetime. Just as God called Abraham to a difficult journey with great blessings, Jesus calls His people to a similar journey through the Sermon on the Mount. In this sermon, the Lord offer several blessings to potential followers. These blessings include the following:

“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 
“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. 
“Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:3,5,10)

The Lord’s call to discipleship through the Gospel is a difficult journey for us. The character virtues of humility, meekness, submission to persecution for the sake of righteousness does not appeal to us. However, the promises of finding life in God’s kingdom and inheriting life on the new heavens and earth can only be realized by embarking on this journey. We can experience the blessings offered by Jesus because one man, Abraham, decided to faithfully respond to God’s call thousands of years ago. We have been entrusted with the Gospel message to call all people to follow Christ. This is how we participate in God’s great promise to Abraham that in him all the world will be blessed. As we do so, we have the promise of Christ presence to the end of the age and we can be assured that God will be faithful to His promises.</Text>

            <Text>“Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land” (12:10). After having obeyed God’s call to go to Canaan and receiving reassurance of the promise, Abraham is confronted with a difficult trial of his faith - he finds himself in the midst of a severe famine. The future looks dim in Canaan. This situation presented an issue of life and death to Abraham and his family. He may have asked God at this point, “I thought you were going to make me into a great nation?” Abraham now had to choose between remaining in the land of promise, thus risking starvation or moving on to greener pastures where his family could survive. In Abraham’s day Egypt was a popular destination to escape famine because agriculture in Egypt was more dependent on the regular flooding of the Nile river. So, Abraham decided to take matters into his own hands and moved his family to Egypt. Did his decision represent a lack of faith in God’s ability to fulfill His promises in Canaan? Maybe so. On the other hand, Abraham may have rationalized that a dead man could not father a great nation.
“When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, ‘I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance, and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me, but they will let you live. Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake’” (12:11-13). There is no doubt that now Abraham demonstrates a lack of faith driven by fear and self-preservation. Instead of trusting God to protect him, Abraham made a self-centered decision to engage in deception. We learn from Genesis 20:13 that when God called him to leave his father’s house, Abraham feared losing his life to powerful men in dangerous territories who might be attracted to his beautiful wife. Now that they are about to enter Egypt and face Pharaoh, Abraham convinces Sarah to enact their brother-sister routine so that he might receive a bride price from interested suitors. 
Does this sound like the same man who demonstrated great faith by leaving family, friends, and homeland in pursuit of a promise he has not seen? Is this the same man who displayed great devotion to God by building altars of worship to the one true God in pagan lands? Here we see that Abraham, known as the friend of God and father of the faithful, struggled with sin and fear as we do today. The Scriptures provide plenty examples of God’s faithful succumbing to sin: Noah and his drunkenness; David and Bathsheba; and Peter’s denial of the Lord. Abraham’s actions shows how deceitful sin is and that we all need to be watchful and vigilant in prayer because the flesh will never be completely  done away with in this life. We all should keep in mind the admonition “therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall” (1 Corinthians 10:12).
“When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels” (12:14-16). Abraham’s fears become realized. Sarah’s beauty has captured the attention of Pharaoh’s princes and consequently she ends up in Pharaoh’s house! In exchange, Abraham is living the high life as he receives animals and servants. What might Sarah be thinking and feeling at this point? Anger? Abandonment? Disappointment? We don’t know Sarah’s state of mind at this point but Abraham’s decision jeopardized her, their marriage, and the fulfillment of God’s promises in their lives. His actions reminds us that we often allow circumstances rather than God’s word to drive our behavior. Just as Abraham, we make decisions which negatively impact our loved ones and distract us from pursuing God’s will. However, as the narrative proceeds, we discover that by God’s grace and mercy we can get back on track. God is willing and able to guide us back to pursuing His will. 
“But the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. So Pharaoh called Abram and said, ‘What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.’ And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had” (12:17-20). Abraham had gotten himself and Sarah into a mess, but God did not give up on him. God did not say, “Abraham, since you made such a foolish, fearful decision you’re disqualified from inheriting my promises. I’m going to call someone else to do what you couldn’t!” Instead, God made it known to Pharaoh  that Sarah was another man’s wife! God delivered Sarah from what appeared to be a hopeless situation. God remained faithful to His promises even though Abraham was temporarily unfaithful. What a great God we serve! This episode bears witness to the truth that God “does not deal with us according to our sins, nor repay us according to our iniquities” (Psalm 103:10). Though Abraham was a great man of faith, he did not merit the promises of God.
After Pharaoh became aware of Sarah’s marital status, he returned her to Abraham and sent them away from Egypt with more possessions than they arrived with. One of those possessions made have included Hagar, Sarah’s personal maid servant. If so, we see that though God shows us mercy and grace through our sins and failures, our choices have enduring consequences. As we live with the ongoing effects of our sinful choices we often struggle with  self-condemnation. However, as with Abraham, we must remind ourselves that God is committed to completing His work of transformation within us until the return of Jesus Christ (Philippians 1:6). 
Furthermore, God can use our failures and sins to teach us valuable lessons in order to prevent us from making more tragic decisions in the future. We learn from this episode that the flesh is at war against the Spirit within us and if we let down our guard the old nature will overpower  our best intentions. Satan, the enemy of our souls, seeks our ultimate destruction; therefore, we ought to be vigilant every moment of our lives. The apostle Peter puts it this way: “Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so That at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. Be sober-minded, be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour” (1 Peter 5:6-8).

            <Text>Though Abraham was a man of great faith, we read that he had ‘feet of clay’ just as we do. When confronted with a dire situation and an encounter with the powerful Egyptians, Abraham resorted to deception because he doubted God’s willingness and ability to deliver him. Abraham focused on the circumstances and allowed fear to drive his decisions rather than faith. This reminds us of the apostle Peter’s experience of walking on water. When he began to focus on the windstorm rather than Jesus, he became afraid and began to sink. The Lord gracefully delivered Peter from drowning just as God delivered Sarah from the clutches of Pharaoh. God provides the same grace to His children today.
The antidote to fear of man and situations is focus on the power and goodness of the Lord. The apostle Paul wrote, “and we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose” (Romans 8:28). We serve a God who uses the good and bad to accomplish His plans for His people. No matter how dire the situation, how the big the obstacles, or how overwhelming the odds may seem God will protect and guide His people by His providential power.</Text>

            <Text>“So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb.” After a temporary lapse of faith in Egypt on Abraham’s part, God delivered Sarah from the hands of the Egyptians. Abraham traveled south through the Negeb back to the area between Bethel and Ai, the place he originally settled after leaving Haran. God has blessed Abraham through his recent episode - he is now “very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold”, indicating that Abraham left Egypt more wealthy than when he arrived. However, riches (nor failure) did not cause him to forget God for the passage reads “and there Abram called upon the name of the Lord” (13:4). Abraham had repented of the sin he had committed in Egypt and consequently, God had forgiven and blessed him. As Christians, when we turn from our sins and sincerely call upon the Lord to forgive us, we experience restoration of sweet fellowship with God. In addition, God can use us in greater service than before. As we will discover in the case of Abraham relationship with his nephew Lot, such blessings do not eliminate trials from our lives. </Text>

            <Title>Cornerstone</Title>
            <Text>“And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents” (13:5). Lot was the son of Abraham’s brother, Haran. Obviously the two shared a close bond, for Abraham took Lot under his wings after the death of Haran. He accompanied Abraham when God called him to leave his homeland. As a result of his association with Abraham, Lot prospered and grew wealthy to the point that the land they lived in could not support both their livestock (13:6). Oftentimes we think that more money and wealth will eliminate the problems of our lives, but here we see the opposite - it created more problems and tension! Verse 7 says “and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land.” Increased blessings led to disputing between the herdsmen of Abraham and Lot due to the lack of land resources. This trial presented another test of Abraham’s faith. How will he deal with the conflict amongst his own family caravan? Will he be passive and allow it to boil to the point of severe conflict? Whatever course of action he would decide upon, the native peoples of the land (the Canaanites and Perizzites) would be witnessing the outcome of the situation. Whenever conflicts arise among Christians, we should view such trials as opportunities to bear strong witness for God to a watching world. 
Notice Abraham’s loving response - “Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen” (13:8). Abraham demonstrates love for Lot by expressing his desire to keep peace between their workers. He doesn’t want the conflict to escalate to the point of more strife because he values Lot’s relationship. It should be remembered that Abraham and Sarah have not conceived children, so most likely he views and loves Lot as a son. Furthermore, Lot had demonstrated great loyalty  in joining Abraham as he followed God and sought the promised land. They would have needed to stick together as they faced great dangers and enemies. Therefore, Abraham sought peace to maintain a good relationship with Lot. Whenever we experience conflicts in our relationships, whether they be in the home, church or at work, we should remember the admonition of Paul to “pursue what makes for peace and for mutual up-building” (Romans 14:19).
What made Abraham’s response even more remarkable is that he gave Lot the option to choose whatever area he wanted to settle (13:9)! Instead of fighting for his rights to the land because he was the head of the family, the leader, and the person to whom God had promised the land, Abraham demonstrated great humility, generosity and faith in giving up his claim to choose first! Abraham shows what is means to “do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves” (Php. 2:3). As Christians, we are to relinquish our rights to choose first in order to enrich others. Abraham was able to do this because he firmly believed God’s promise to ultimately give him the land. When we are focused on God promises and secured in Christ, we become less concerned about accumulating money and possessions. When we are willing to seek God and His righteousness above all else, we are able live selflessly because we know that God will meet all of our needs. 
Did Lot return the favor by declining first choice to the land? No. In contrast to Abraham, he jumped at the opportunity to enrich himself: “And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar” (13:10a). Just as Eve was attracted by the fruit of the forbidden tree (Genesis 3:6), Lot is attracted what he sees in the Jordan Valley where the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were located. Instead of trusting God and walking by faith, Lot chooses to walk by selfishness and greed. Even though Abraham had demonstrated great love for Lot by rearing him, educating him and contributing blessings to him, Lot chose what he thought was the best thing for himself. Sooner and later, Lot’s choices will prove to be unwise and disastrous for him and all those with him. When we are misled by the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life (as Lot was), we make similar decisions filled with negative spiritual impact. Therefore, we must make decisions such as where to live and work, who to date and marry, and what to entertain ourselves with in light of God’s will. That’s why it is important to “not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect” (Romans 12:2).
After Lot separated from him and settled near the wicked men of Sodom, God reaffirmed his promises to Abraham. Lot had selfishly lifted up his eyes and choose land that seemed best for himself settle, but God instructed Abraham, “lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever” (13:14-15). What irony! In a situation in which Abraham seemed to have gotten a raw deal, God lets him know that this is only a temporary setback! God’s sovereign will is to give the entire land (including what Lot chose for himself) to Abraham and his descendants to possess forever. Through this entire ordeal, Abraham lifted up his eyes in humility and selflessness. Through this entire trial, Abraham lifted up his eyes to God in faith and trust. And now God has reaffirmed his covenant with Abraham, letting him know that the current state of affairs will not last forever. 
Abraham’s exemplary faith in this situation reminds us of the Beatitude, “blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth” (Matt. 5:5). Meekness should not be equated with weakness. We should remember that Abraham was by no means inferior to Lot, for he was a highly skilled military leader who could have easily dominated the situation. By example, he teaches us to be humble, dependent on God, and willing to look not only to our own interests, but also to the interests of others (Php. 2:4). Our Lord Jesus put forth the supreme example of selflessness who “though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich” (2 Corinthians 8:9)
Abraham also teaches us that the proper response to God’s grace is a life of worship. After the Lord reaffirmed his promises, “Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord” (12:18). As Abraham continued on his journey of faith in Canaan, he worshiped and left witness that the true and living God had promised him the land. On our journey of faith, we are to present ourselves as living sacrifices holy and acceptable to God, which is our spiritual worship (Romans 12:1). In doing so, we bear witness to the mercies of God.

            <Text>This episode in Abraham’s life demonstrates that for us faithful living involves both failure and success. Though Abraham failed miserably under cowardice in Egypt, he responded peacefully through humility and meekness to the conflict that threaten his and Lot’s relationship. In a magnanimous act, Abraham trusted God to provide in letting Lot choose what appears to be the best land to support his livestock. By contrast, Lot makes a decision that takes him away from godly influence and puts himself in dire circumstances. Consequently, God reaffirms his promise to Abram to give him all the land and to make him a great nation. In a sense, Abraham points us to our Lord Jesus who humbled himself to crucifixion on the cross and then is highly exalted by God above every creature in heaven and on earth (Php. 2:9-11). May we keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and seek to live, through the power of the Spirit, as selflessly as he. </Text>

Abram’s responsive acceptance of God contrasted sharply with humanity’s continual resistance (except for Noah; see Gen 6:9–8:22). With Abram, God finally found someone who embraced His offer of blessing in exchange for obedience.

Abram was forced to choose: remain in the land of promise and risk death by starvation, or relocate temporarily to Egypt and risk death at the hand of foreign enemies. Abram had just received God’s promise that he would become a “great nation” (Gen 12:2), but that future now appeared to be in jeopardy.

            <Synopsis>Famines were not unusual in ancient Mesopotamia. Often caused by drought, famines jeopardized the food supplies of animals and people alike, and they quickly became a matter of life and death. Agriculture in Egypt was less dependent on rain than agriculture in Canaan: The regular flooding of the Nile provided water for crops. During times of famine, people living in Canaan often traveled to Egypt, knowing they would likely find food there. Egyptian tomb carvings from around the 20th century BC such as the Beni Hasan mural show Semitic people traveling to Egypt.

            <Synopsis>Still, Abram’s decision to travel to Egypt revealed a surprising lack of faith, especially since it came directly on the heels of God’s call and promise to him (Gen 12:1–9). God had instructed Abram to go “to the land that I will show you” (Gen 12:1), promising that the land would belong to him and his descendants (Gen 12:7). Given God’s recent promise, Abram should have had more confidence.

            <Synopsis>On some level, Abram’s lack of faith was driven by the overwhelming instinct of self-preservation: He didn’t want to die. This also manifested as a lack of concern for Sarai. Abram persuaded her to participate in his deception, claiming that he would be killed if she did not. He failed to recognize that because of their ploy, an Egyptian would take her as his wife. Abram’s concern for his own survival blinded him to the issues of Sarai’s purity and protection.

In this light, Abram’s focus on his survival reflects a concern to neutralize threats against the fulfillment of God’s promise. How could a dead man father a great nation? This episode (and the parallel account of Gen 20) presents Abram struggling with fear—the fear of losing God’s promised inheritance

Abram was an idolater. He came from a pagan country and from a pagan nation and from a pagan home. His family worshipped idols, and estranged themselves from the one true God. Joshua gives us this little bit of information in Joshua 24:2. In speaking to Israel he says:

  Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.

Abram says to Sarai:

  When the Egyptians shall see thee … they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
  Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee (Genesis 12:12–13).

Is this the same man who trusted God, of whom we read, “He was the friend of God,” and “the father of the faithful”? Yes, it is the same man—none other than this same Abram, Abram’s action only proves how deceitful the flesh is, even in the believer, and how we ought to be on guard against it every moment. The Bible knows no such thing as the eradication of the flesh while we are here below. It is still in us to overpower us the moment we are off guard and leave the place of perfect obedience. The saintliest and holiest believer is not immune to the flesh and temptation, but is all too prone to yield and submit to it when it appears that obedience to God may cost him too great a price.

While Abram was unfaithful, God remained faithful. We might expect God to say, “Well, Abram, you got yourself into this mess, now you can stew in your own fat. I am going to give you up. I’m all through with you. I’ll call somebody else.” Did God do anything of the kind? Listen to the record:

  And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife (Genesis 12:17).

            <Synopsis>Scholars debate the precise identification of Ur of the Chaldeans from which Abram moved. The excavations of Sir Leonard Woolley at Ur in the 1920s and 1930 have led many to assume that the Ur from which Abram departed is the Sumerian Ur, that is, the great city in Lower Mesopotamia located on the Euphrates.

Other scholars have challenged this identification and suggested that Abram’s Ur is to be located in Upper Mesopotamia. Before Sumerian Ur came to light, writers were already equating Abraham’s Ur with Urfa (now called Edessa), which is about twenty miles northwest of Haran. A more recent proposal is to identify the Ur of Gen. 11 with a town called Ura in Hittite territory.

This would have been true with Abram and his family and close relatives. It must have been very difficult for Abram to leave and forever separate himself from his loved ones. Yet this was exactly what God demanded of Abram.

⇒	It is simply the demand that we focus our minds and hearts first of all upon God.
⇒	It is simply the demand that we put God first in our lives, before family members, even before father or mother.
⇒	It is simply the demand that we seek God first, seek Him even before food, shelter, and clothing.
⇒	It is simply the demand that we focus our attention and affections on things above, lasting things, not on things of the earth, things that are temporary.
“Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth” (Col. 3:2).
⇒	It is simply the demand that we not trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God.
“Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy” (1 Ti. 6:17).

“They came to Haran.” Haran is an ancient and well-known city on the left bank of the Belikh, a tributary of the Euphrates; in cuneiform it is Harrānu(m), often mentioned in the Mari texts. Some scholars think that the name is Hurrian (F. M. T. Böhl and others); later it was karrhä, today once more Harran. The city belonged to the Mitanni empire, then to the Hittite, and afterwards to the Assyrian. The last Assyrian king fled there, and the last Babylonian king, Nabonidus, favored it.
Haran is mentioned in the context of the patriarchal story in Gen. 11:31*, 32*; 12:4*, 5*; 27:43*; 28:10*; 29:4*; in Gen. 24 it is the city of Nahor, Laban, and Rebecca. Such extensive attestation points to the likelihood that it is the place of origin of Abraham’s ancestors.

“Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, 3 and said to him, ‘Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.’ 4 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. 5 Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot’s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. 6 And God spoke to this effect—that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. 7 ‘But I will judge the nation that they serve,’ said God, ‘and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.’ 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.

            <Title>Separation from the World</Title>
            <Text>Worldliness can be defined as a love for and a willingness to conform to the sinful values and practices of society. In addition, it can include attachment to the things (good or bad) of this life. Separation from the world means that we desire to know God above all else, seeking to conform one’s life to His ways and living by faith in His promises. In leaving his homeland, he demonstrated separation (or detachment) from the world. The writer of Hebrews argues that Abram was looking for a homeland, but that it was a “better one, a heavenly homeland” (Hebrews 11:13-16). Abraham valued the promises of God over the things he possessed in Mesopotamia or would acquire in his travels. 
Like Abraham, we are called to value the things of God above the temporal things of this life. We are often consumed with physical necessities, but the life of faith demands that we “…seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.”  We often seek to make as much money as we can, but the life of faith demands that we lay up treasures in heaven. Jesus’ interaction with a certain rich man and the subsequent response of his disciples is instructive. This man diligently sought after Jesus to find out what he needed to do to inherit eternal life. This man’s religious zeal was undeniable. From childhood he had dedicated his life to observing the Ten Commandments. However, one thing stood in the way of him obtaining eternal life - attachment to his great possessions. Since he valued material wealth over following Jesus, it was impossible for him to enter the kingdom of God.
By contrast, the twelve disciples (with the exception of Judas Iscariot) left everything to follow Jesus. In Mark 1:16-20 we read that Peter, Andrew, and the sons of Zebedee (James and John) left their occupations and family business to follow Jesus. In return, the Lord promised that they would receive a hundred times (along with persecutions) what they sacrificed in this life and in the “age to come eternal life” (Mark 10:30). Like Abraham, the disciples demonstrated willingness to give up everything in order to live a life of faith under the Lord’s direction. What about us? Are we willing to trust God enough to detach from those things that bring status, influence, privilege, and comfort? Are we willing to embark on the journey of faith and give up the quest to create our own security in this life?

            <Title>Separation from Family and Friends</Title>
            <Text>God’s call to Abraham demanded that he leave his family, but we know from 12:4-5 that he was accompanied by a sizeable caravan that included his wife Sarai and his nephew Lot. How did Sarai respond? Did she question whether he really heard from God? Did his relatives and friends try to persuade to remain in Haran? Did they question Abraham’s mental stability in following a ‘God’ that was foreign to his people? How easy was it for Abraham to leave his extended family and homeland? We don’t know the answers to these questions, but Abraham responded with obedience. Later on in the narrative, we will discover that Abraham remains faithful through the challenges of family strife and doubt. In addition, he will pass the test of supreme love for God by being willing to sacrifice Isaac.
The walk of faith demands supreme love for Jesus who said, “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me” (Matthew 10:37). Our Lord knows that for some, allegiance to himself will lead to family conflict. In such cases, we must not value our attachment to family so highly that we cave under the pressure of persecution. And like Abraham, we must not cherish our families so highly that it prevents us from fulfilling God’s call on our lives.

            <Synopsis>The OT concept of repentance is expressed with two key Hebrew terms: שׁוּב (šûb) and נָחַם (nāḥam). The Hebrew word šûb (“turn”) expresses repentance as turning away from the wrong path, i.e., sinful behavior, and turning back toward God (Hos 3:5). Thus, repentance is an act of reorientation. The term nāḥam (“console”) can have a number of different meanings, including feeling sorrow or remorse; it can thus express the aspect of repentance that involves contrition for wrongdoing (Job 42:6).

            <Synopsis>
More specifically, the present verse forms the minor premise of a syllogism:

    they said they were looking for a homeland (v. 14)
    it could not have been their earthly birthplace (v. 15)
    so it must have been a home in heaven (v. 16a).

Moreover, this whole argument is a midrash tied to ξένοι καὶ παρεπίδημοι in → v. 13, and thus ultimately to Abraham’s words in Gn. 23:4, though Jacob is associated with him, perhaps as a second witness, and the language of exile has wider implications. The argument, as Hebrews develops it, has no direct basis in the OT text. Its immediate basis, moreover, is not Abraham’s words themselves, but the conclusion drawn from them in v. 14 that Abraham, and thus by implication the fathers generally, were looking for a homeland (still to be defined). This homeland, the author argues, could not have been Ur because Abraham knew where it was and could have returned there at any time. In fact, not only did he not do so, but he prevented his descendants from doing so

17 And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” 18 And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. 19 You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.’ ” 20 And he said to him, “Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth.” 21 And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, “You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” 22 Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. 
23 And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!” 24 And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, “Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” 26 And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, “Then who can be saved?” 27 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God.” 28 Peter began to say to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.” 29 Jesus said, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, 30 who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. 31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Mk 10:17–31). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

17–20. The rich man sought to honor Jesus by kneeling before him and addressing him as “Good Teacher.” Jesus’ objection to being called “good” is surprising to many. However, as Lane suggests, “In calling in question the man’s use of ‘good,’ Jesus’ intention is not to pose the question of his own sinlessness or oneness with the Father, but to set in correct perspective the honor of God.” This man undoubtedly viewed himself as “good” and needed to see that “his only hope is an utter reliance upon God, who alone can bestow eternal life.”18
The question, “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” further suggests the trust that this man had in Jesus. In reply to the man’s question, he recalls in summary fashion several of the ten commandments. The rich man had kept the ten commandments from childhood.
21. It is easy to think of the rich man as simply a pawn in Jesus’ teaching game, as if he gave this man the challenge to give his wealth away in order to use his failure as an object lesson. But Mark says that Jesus “loved him.” Jesus saw great potential in the man’s trust in him, desire for salvation, and righteous lifestyle. He wanted the man to be one of his chosen followers.
22. The rich man’s response reveals his sincerity. The first verb Mark uses to describe his reaction can be translated in two ways. The NIV translation, “the man’s face fell” is an attempt to express one meaning of the word στυγνάσας (stygnasas), which is that his appearance indicated he was gloomy or sad. The NRSV “he was shocked” expresses the alternative. In either case the next phrase says that he went away grieving, because he had great wealth. His wealth was the one thing he would not give up to inherit eternal life.
23–25. Jesus used this opportunity to teach his disciples about wealth. It is hard for anyone to enter the kingdom of God. It is especially hard for a rich man. In fact Jesus uses a hyperbolic illustration which characterizes a rich man’s possibilities for entering the kingdom of God as nonexistent. There is no ancient evidence for the oft-cited opinion that the eye of the needle was a gate into the walls of Jerusalem that a camel could enter only with great difficulty.20 Jesus had in mind the eye of a literal needle.
26. The shock expressed by the disciples in vv. 24 and 26 may reveal an underlying theology that supposes that rich men like the one they had just seen are rich because they are blessed by God for their righteousness. Their reaction, “Who then can be saved?” seems to imply that the rich would be especially likely to be saved. If they are not saved, then who can be?
27. Fortunately, impossibilities are possible for God. Rich men can be saved and so can the rest of humanity.
28. Peter’s statement sought credit for doing what Jesus told the rich man to do. The twelve had left everything they had behind and followed Jesus. Peter’s language reflects the responses of Peter and Andrew in 1:18 as “they left their nets and followed him” and of James and John in 1:20 as “they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.” The four fishermen had heeded the call and paid a high price.

29–30. Jesus began his reply to Peter with a commendation of his sacrifice. With his customary “I tell you the truth” he emphasized the truth and significance of his promise. Those who sacrifice houses or family or fields for the sake of Jesus or the gospel will receive one hundred times what they have sacrificed in the present life and in the age to come they will receive eternal life. In a later text Jesus tells the disciples that Christians will suffer great family trials as “brother will betray brother to death and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death. All men will hate you because of me …” (13:12–13). This statement fills out both the sense in which many may have to leave family members and the ominous reference to “and with them, persecutions” in the promise of reward. Of course, Jesus’ promise does not involve literal multiplications of new family members or houses or fields. The sense in which one gains new family members may be illuminated by Mark 3:34, “Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.” For the multiple returns on houses and fields one might consult Acts 2:44–45: “All the believers were together and had everything in common. Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.”


31. This paradoxical saying is apparently a rebuke of the down side of Peter’s statement. Peter has expressed the “me-first” attitude that keeps coming through in the disciples’ behavior (see 8:33–34, 38; 10:13, 35–37, 41) despite Jesus’ repeated efforts to dispel it. Jesus warns Peter that those who place themselves first will be last and vice versa. This statement is more fully illuminated in Matt 19:27–20:16. There Peter’s attitude is more clearly displayed by the addition of his statement, “What then will there be for us?” (19:27). The paradox of the first and last is followed by the parable of the Workers in the Vineyard and, in 20:16, a repetition of the paradox.

            <Text>To enter the kingdom of God one must submit to God’s rule so that God reigns over every aspect of life.
Disciples must be prepared to give up everything. Peter quickly reminds Jesus that they have done exactly that. Jesus promises that their sacrifice will not be for naught. Those who have left earthly attachments for the sake of the gospel will receive hundredfold rewards—but “with … persecutions” (10:30). In this age, those who become homeless will have a home among those who receive them (see 6:10). Those who surrender families will become part of a greater family not based on biological kinship (3:33–35). Those who leave fields will be given greater fields of mission opportunity (see Matt. 9:37–38). Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 400). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

The point of this story is not to drive home the need for all of Jesus’ followers to sell their possessions.Jesus did not insist that Zacchaeus sell all his goods and give them to the poor before he would deign to eat with him. Zacchaeus voluntarily offers to give up half of his possessions and to restore fourfold whatever he may have gained by fraud (see Ex. 22:1; Lev. 5:16; Num. 5:7). This willingness to make things right evokes Jesus’ response, “Today salvation has come to this house” (Luke 19:8–9). Jesus’ encounter with this rich man in Mark serves to illustrate how difficult it is for the rich (or any one, for that matter) to do this. Few are willing to risk divesting themselves of whatever provides them security in this life to enter a new quality of life under God’s rule. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (pp. 402–403). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

Wealth possesses high voltage and explosive energy since so many crave it and it strikes such reverence in the heart. No Christian is immune from the danger of Mammon. Covetousness is like a virus that takes residence in the soul and begins slowly to work its destruction. The love of acquisition and an appetite for self-gratification will deaden the instinct for self-sacrifice. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 403). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

Jesus said that the rich man in this story lacked one thing, though he did not specify what it was. In applying this passage to our contemporary situation we can imagine that he lacked the very things that we ourselves may lack. First, this man lacked for nothing. He had too much to give up. Money brings people many things (honor, respect, admiration, power, beauty, sex), which is why it is so alluring. Wealth cannot make one holy or purchase eternal life, and it does not offer any deep happiness, even when people get more than their fair share. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 406). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.

The second thing this man lacked was trust. God requires something more than simply reverence for Jesus and zealous attempts at obedience. God requires radical trust. Like so many today, this rich man wanted to serve God on his own terms. He obeyed all the commandments that suited him but resisted giving his whole life over to God. He was “afraid to expose himself to the uncertainties and insecurities of the future” or to make himself vulnerable as a child. He accumulated possessions to secure his life in this world, and he accumulated obedience to the commandments to secure his life in the world to come.25 In a culture that has grown wary of commitment and risk, few want to bet their whole lives on Jesus. They also want to keep a material safety net and refuse to disentangle themselves from something that brings status, influence, and privilege. Few are willing to trust that there will be other brothers and sisters in the faith who will watch over them and care for them, partly because we do not watch out for them. To have life, one must trust God and give up the quest to create one’s own security. Garland, D. E. (1996). Mark (p. 407). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House.</Text>

            <Text>37. It is affection that binds households together; thus Jesus moves on to consider the place of love. He assumes that there will be love between parents and children, but claims for himself a higher place in his disciples’ affection than that which they accord to their nearest and dearest on earth, and that in a society that held it a dreadful thing to put anyone higher than one’s parents. 


Loves88 is a significant word; it points to the warmest affection. Jesus does not bid his followers love their parents or their children (nor, on the other hand, does he forbid warm affection in the family). He simply assumes that family members will love one another. But he is concerned that they must not value their attachment to the members of their families so highly that he is pushed into the background. This has important implications for an understanding of the person of Jesus. 


No mere man has the right to claim a love higher than that for parents or children; it is only because he is who he is that Jesus can look for such love. The words imply that he is more than a merely human teacher and leader. Of the one who lacks this love for him he says that he is not worthy of me (GNB, “is not fit to be my disciple”). 


We must not forget that Jesus knew what it was to experience misunderstanding in the family, for his own thought him mad (Mark 3:21). Jesus is not asking from his followers something he did not know for himself.

            <Text>37. Because of the division which Jesus provokes within families (vv. 34–36), true discipleship may bring a conflict of loyalties, and in that case, following Jesus must take precedence over the natural love of family (the Greek word is phileō, natural affection, not agapaō, the loving commitment which is a Christian characteristic). 


The Christian may even have to leave his family (19:29). The Lucan parallel (Luke 14:26) calls for ‘hatred’ of the family, but Matthew’s version correctly interprets this Semitic idiom (cf. Gen. 29:31; Deut. 21:15; Mal. 1:2–3) as an expression of prior loyalty or of choice rather than of actual dislike. Jesus calls not for an unloving attitude, but for a willingness to put him first in the concrete situation where the calls of Jesus and of family conflict. 



For the Rabbis too the claims of the teacher came before those of the father (Mishnah, BM 2:11). For worthy, see on v. 11; ‘not the right sort to be my disciple’.

            <Text>This passage is unique to Luke, though verses 26–27 are like Matthew 10:37–38 and verses 34–35 are similar to Matthew 5:13 and Mark 9:49–50. It is extremely significant that this passage is addressed to large crowds. Jesus offered himself to all, but he also was honest from the very beginning of his preaching about what the journey would involve. What Jesus asks for is first place in one’s heart. That is what successful discipleship requires.

So Jesus calls for a follower who will hate his mother and father, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life. The point of the list is that no other relationship is first for a disciple. “Hate” is used figuratively and suggests a priority of relationship. Jesus is first. To follow Jesus means to follow Jesus, not anyone or anything else. A disciple is a learner, and the primary teacher in life is Jesus. This total loyalty is crucial, given the rejection and persecution that lie ahead. If his followers care more about family than about Jesus, when families are divided under pressure of persecution, they will choose against Jesus. This is what lies behind Jesus’ remarks. Discipleship is not possible if Jesus is not the teacher.

            <Text>

God was choosing Abram to bless the whole earth—all the families of the earth—with the promised seed, the Messiah, the Savior of the world. How do we know this? From Scripture: Scripture clearly tells us that this is a reference to the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. This will be seen in a moment. But common logic and reason also tells us that the promised seed is a reference to the Messiah. Just think: this is a blessing so great that it blesses all the families upon earth, all the families who have lived or ever will live. A blessing this great could only refer to the Savior. Only God Himself—through His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ—could do something so great that it would literally bless every single family upon earth throughout all the generations of human history. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 26). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

 As stated above, Scripture tells us exactly what God meant in this promise: this is a direct—very specific—reference to the promised seed, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Messiah and Savior of the world.
1)	Note the Old Testament references.
a)	God gave the promise of the Savior at least three times to Abram.
 (Ge. 12:3).
(Ge. 22:18).
b)	God confirmed the promise of the Savior to Isaac, Abram’s son.
 (Ge. 26:3–4).
c)	God also confirmed the promise of the Savior to Jacob.
(Ge. 28:14). Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 26). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Note the New Testament references and interpretation.
a)	The first New Testament reference is Acts 3:25. Peter preached this glorious fact: Jesus Christ fulfilled the covenant given to Abraham and the other godly fathers of history. What covenant? The covenant of the promised seed, the Lord Jesus Christ, who would bless people and turn them away from their wicked ways. Note this clear declaration: Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 26). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

 25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ 26 God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.” The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ac 3:24–26). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

	The third New Testament reference is Ga. 3:8. This verse explains a surprising fact: the promise of the promised seed actually contained the gospel. The gospel of Jesus Christ was actually being preached to Abraham when God promised to give him the promised seed. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 27). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

7 Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. 8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” 9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 3:7–9). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

The fourth New Testament reference is Ga. 3:16. This verse gives a clear explanation: the promise of the seed is singular, not plural. The promised seed does not refer to many persons, but to one person, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior and Messiah of the world Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 27). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

16 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 3:16). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

Note this also: a person can only become a child of God’s—Abram’s seed (descendant)—and inherit the promise made to Abram, by faith in Christ, by believing and trusting Him. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 27). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

26 for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. 27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. 29 And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ga 3:26–29). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

3 (12:6) Faith—Testing—Pilgrim—Pilgrimage: there was the testing of faith: Abram reached the land, but he could not settle down within it; he had to pass through the land as a pilgrim, for there was opposition there (the Canaanites). Think for a moment: when Abram arrived in Canaan, what was he expecting to find? A land uninhabited and unpossessed, a free land ready to be claimed by the first pioneer to settle within its borders? Or, was Abram expecting the land to be settled and possessed by people? Scripture does not say, but when Abram crossed the border of Canaan, he found a land already inhabited. The Canaanites, a godless nation of people, were already there. Abram faced a formidable enemy if he began to claim the land. He could easily see that he was not going to possess the land within the foreseeable future. All kinds of questions must have flashed across his mind. He must have been gripped with …
•	uncertainty
•	misgivings
•	hesitation
•	questioning
Could it be that he had misread God, that he had made a mistake?
Abram’s faith was tested, sorely tested. The faith of this great pioneer for God was tested to the nth degree. He was in the land, but he could not yet possess it. Opposition and strong forces stood toe to toe against his claim to the promised land. What was he to do?
⇒	Should he return? Should he give up his faith, turn around and go back home to Haran or to Ur of the Chaldees?
⇒	Should he continue to believe God, following after God’s promises, continue to claim the promises of God despite the opposition and the impossible situation that confronted him? Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 33). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.


Thought 1. There is a beautiful analogy for the believer in this experience of Abram. Just as Abram reached the promised land but did not yet physically possess it, so the believer reaches the promised land of heaven immediately upon conversion, but does not yet physically possess it.
When a person is saved—when he truly begins to follow after God and His promises—things happen to him in relation to heaven.
(1)	God counts the believer as already in heaven (see note 3—Ep. 2:6). The believer is not physically in heaven, but he is as good as there. God has promised heaven to him, and what God promises always takes place; thus, the believer is counted as being in heaven, as already there. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 34). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, 5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— 6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Eph 2:4–7). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

The believer is immediately placed in the heavenly realm or the spiritual realm of life. That is, his mind and thoughts are focused upon heaven and the things of heaven, upon God and His promises. It is God’s Spirit that pulls his mind to spiritual things, that stirs his mind to focus upon heaven and the things of heaven. As stated, the believer is not bodily in heaven, but his mind is to be kept within the realm (upon the things) of heaven. In fact, if he is truly following after God and His promises, he naturally keeps his mind and thoughts upon God and His promises—the Spirit of God stirs him to so focus his mind. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 34). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

The believer’s faith in the promised land of heaven is constantly tested just as Abram’s was. In fact, the believer is never free from enemies who oppose his inheriting the promised land of heaven. Godless foes—death, Satan, and all kinds of trials and temptations—stand against him while he is living within this world. Just like Abram, the believer is to continue trusting God: he is to believe that God will defeat all the enemies of the promised land, including that final enemy, death. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 34). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Just like Abram, the believer is a pilgrim upon earth: he lives upon earth, but he is only traveling and passing through, ever seeking for the promised land of heaven. The believer is a citizen of both earth and heaven (Ph. 3:20–21). Note this: just like Abram …
•	the believer journeys upon earth, but his destination is the promised land
•	this is not the believer’s home; heaven is his home
•	the believer’s mind and thoughts are upon the earth when necessary, but they are mostly upon the promised land of God
•	the believer’s faith and hope are not in this world, but in God and in the land promised by God
Again, the believer is just like Abram: he is a pilgrim upon earth. He lives for the earth, yes, to make it a far better place; but he also lives for heaven, knowing that this earth is only his temporary home. Simply stated, the true believer knows what Abram knew: he is only a pilgrim upon earth; the promised land of heaven is his eternal destiny. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 34–35). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

20 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, 21 who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Php 3:20–21). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

This is what is meant by the pilgrimage of faith. The believer actually lives upon earth, but he believes that in Christ he lives in the promised land of heaven, and he believes that some day he will bodily live there. Thus, the believer lives upon earth as a pilgrim: his life is a pilgrimage of faith. His life, movements, and being—all that he is—are a pilgrimage of faith.
The point is this: when a person believes in God and His promises, he lives for God and His promises. He lives for something far beyond this earth. This earth is not his home, not his destination or resting place. His faith is in God and in the promised land; thus he lives upon earth as a pilgrim. His life upon earth becomes a pilgrimage of faith. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 35). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. 8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord. 9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb. The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Ge 12:7–9).

What was Abram’s response? Abram made the decision for God, to continue following after God and His promises. Note that he built an altar to the Lord who had appeared to him (v. 8). The altar had at least seven purposes (see Deeper Study # 1—Ge. 8:20 for more discussion):
⇒	To offer sacrifices to God, asking forgiveness for unbelief and sins.
⇒	To make a rededication to God, renewing his commitment to God.
⇒	To seek God’s continued presence and guidance.
⇒	To worship the Lord: to worship the very Person who had met his need.
⇒	To acknowledge the Lord, that the Lord alone could fulfill so great a promise, that he was totally dependent upon the Lord.
⇒	To praise the Lord, to praise Him for giving so wonderful a promise.
⇒	To testify to the Lord, to bear witness to the Lord’s glorious goodness in meeting his need and in giving so great a promise. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 36). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Thought 1. James Montgomery Boice states the point well:
I note this sequence: first, Abram arrives in a place; second, God speaks to him; third, he builds an altar.… I think the sequence is to be understood as being repeated, though it is not always spelled out in detail. First, Abram arrived at a place. Second, he recognized God’s presence. Third, he raised an altar as a testimony to God’s claim upon that place and on those who should ever after live there. Abram passed on—to other places and eventually to glory—but the altars remained. They remained as witness to the fact that in this place a child of God once knelt and prayed, proclaimed the gospel of grace, and claimed that spot for God’s glory.
We are called to do that—wherever we are and at all times. We are called to be pilgrims, but that does not mean that we are to pass through this world and leave it untouched. For the master of the heavenly city is master of this world too, and we are ambassadors of His kingdom and are charged with proclaiming His rule, and actually establishing that rule, wherever our pilgrimage takes us. Do you live on this or that street? On this or that block? Then you must build your altar on that street and claim that neighborhood for Jesus. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996).

&quot;The greatness of Abram’s name is clearly seen in secular history.
⇒Abram gave rise to both the Jewish and Arab nations of the earth. Both peoples trace their ancestry back to Abram and call him the father of their people.
⇒Abram was to become the father of kings (Ge. 17:6), and Sarah the mother of nations and kings (Ge. 17:16).
⇒Abram was known as a mighty prince by the surrounding nations even in his day (Ge. 21:22–34; 23:6).
⇒Abram was also known as a prophet of God (Ge. 20:7).
b)But more than secular history, Abram’s name is great in the annals of faith. All believers (all those who understand that Abram is the father of faith) honor Abram. The very name of Abram is synonymous with faith. &quot;
Link
&quot;#Abram has blessed the earth with a great example of faith, perhaps the greatest of examples. Abram believed God against all odds.
⇒He believed God for the promised land even when he knew nothing about the land, not even where it was; and he continued to believe God for the land all through his life, even though he never possessed a single acre.
⇒He believed God for the promised seed—a great nation of people—when it was humanly impossible for him and his dear wife to have a child.
⇒He believed God for the promised seed—the Savior—even though he had been living the most undeserving life when God first called him to turn away from the world and follow God. This we shall see in the next note.&quot;
Link
&quot;The memory of Abram’s name is precious (great) to believers because they know this: if they follow after the glorious promises given to Abram, then the great inheritance given to Abram will also become their inheritance.
“For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.… Therefore it [righteousness] is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all” (Ro. 4:13, 16).&quot;
Link
8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” 9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.

12 Now the Lord said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father’s house to the land that I will show you. 2 And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. 3 I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.” 

4 So Abram went, as the Lord had told him, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran. 5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their possessions that they had gathered, and the people that they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, 6 Abram passed through the land to the place at Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land. 7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. 8 From there he moved to the hill country on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. And there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord. 9 And Abram journeyed on, still going toward the Negeb.

But it is also a difficult mission. As it was difficult for Abram to leave his country, his kindred, and especially his father’s house (his immediate relatives), so Jesus declares that ours is a difficult mission. He says, “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it” (Matt 10:37–39). We may lose our life on this mission, but in losing it we will find it.
Jesus begins his Sermon on the Mount with a ninefold blessing for his people—just as God sent Abram on his mission with a complete set of blessings. Jesus proclaims:
“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.…
Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.…
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”
(Matt 5:3, 5, 10)
The poor in spirit will find life in the kingdom of heaven; the meek will find life on the new earth; the persecuted will find life in the kingdom of heaven.
Did you notice, Jesus says that the meek “will inherit the earth.” The new earth will be the inheritance of God’s people. As Canaan was Israel’s inheritance, so the new earth will be God’s people’s inheritance. The new earth will be God’s gift to his people. John saw “the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” And he heard a voice from the throne saying,
“See, the home of God is among mortals.
He will dwell with them;
they will be his peoples,
and God himself will be with them.”
(Rev 21:3)
And then John sees Paradise on earth. He writes, “Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.… On either side of the river is the tree of life.… Nothing accursed will be found there any more. But the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him; they will see his face” (Rev 22:1–4).
One day this earth will again be like Paradise, “the garden of God,” a wonderful place with plenty of food and drink, meaningful work caring for God’s creation, and above all, close fellowship with God. The restored earth will be God’s gift to his people.
But the gift-character of the new earth does not diminish our calling today to reclaim the world for God’s kingdom. Jesus’ command still holds: “Go … and make disciples of all nations.… And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age” (Matt 28:19–20). God gives his people the earth in order to reclaim it for the kingdom of God. Greidanus, S. (2007). Preaching Christ from Genesis: Foundations for Expository Sermons (pp. 155–157).

            <Text>Abram and Sarai in Egypt
10 Now there was a famine in the land. So Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was severe in the land. 11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “I know that you are a woman beautiful in appearance, 12 and when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me, but they will let you live. 13 Say you are my sister, that it may go well with me because of you, and that my life may be spared for your sake.” 14 When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 15 And when the princes of Pharaoh saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh. And the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house. 16 And for her sake he dealt well with Abram; and he had sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants, female donkeys, and camels. 

17 But the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. 18 So Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 19 Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go.” 20 And Pharaoh gave men orders concerning him, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.

            <Text>Historical/Cultural context

Famines were not unusual in ancient Mesopotamia. Often caused by drought, famines jeopardized the food supplies of animals and people alike, and they quickly became a matter of life and death. Agriculture in Egypt was less dependent on rain than agriculture in Canaan: The regular flooding of the Nile provided water for crops. During times of famine, people living in Canaan often traveled to Egypt, knowing they would likely find food there. Egyptian tomb carvings from around the 20th century BC such as the Beni Hasan mural show Semitic people traveling to Egypt.

            <Text>&quot;There was a famine in the land of plenty, the land flowing with milk and honey, a famine in the land to which Abram had gone in faith and obedience to God’s own command and word. Certainly here is a severe test of faith&quot;
Link
&quot;The moment we are willing to yield to the new light that God gives us, He moves us on to the next test; and each one makes us stronger in the faith&quot;
Link
&quot;The lesson taught here is that it is better to starve in the place where God wants you to be than to live in luxury, but not according to the will of God, in Egypt.&quot;
Link
&quot;There comes a disturbing situation, a famine in the land. How it must have troubled Abram. Was he not where God wanted him? Was he not in the place of fellowship? Then why a famine in the land? It was indeed a great test of faith, and Abram, we are sorry to say, failed, miserably failed. Instead of trusting God, he turned to his own reason, and sought the solution in the arm of the flesh. &quot;
Link
&quot;Abram first of all lost his sense of peace and security; he began to worry. He feared for Sarai his wife; for she was very beautiful, and he feared that these conscienceless Egyptians might kill him and take Sarai. How much better to have trusted the Lord in Canaan. &quot;
Link
&quot;When the Egyptians shall see thee … they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee (Genesis 12:12–13).
Is this the same man who trusted God, of whom we read, “He was the friend of God,” and “the father of the faithful”? Yes, it is the same man—none other than this same Abram, Abram’s action only proves how deceitful the flesh is, even in the believer, and how we ought to be on guard against it every moment.&quot;
Link
&quot;The Bible knows no such thing as the eradication of the flesh while we are here below. It is still in us to overpower us the moment we are off guard and leave the place of perfect obedience. &quot;
Link
&quot;While Abram was unfaithful, God remained faithful. We might expect God to say, “Well, Abram, you got yourself into this mess, now you can stew in your own fat. I am going to give you up. I’m all through with you. I’ll call somebody else.” Did God do anything of the kind? Listen to the record:
And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife (Genesis 12:17).&quot;
Link
&quot;God even allows mistakes to be committed by us in order that He may use those experiences and mistakes to prevent something more tragic later on.&quot;
Link
God’s permissive will. 
&quot;We need to recognize this great fundamental truth, that God permitted Abram to be tempted and to fall, knowing that he would make this grievous error and commit a great sin, in order that God might use even this failure and this sin as a means of teaching Abram a still greater lesson which might prevent a still greater tragedy in his life later on.&quot;
Link
&quot;Abram trusted God to save him, but he could not trust God to keep him. Regarding his being kept, Abram felt that he had to do something himself. There are thousands of poor souls today who trust God to save their souls, and then think that they have to do the rest. They cannot trust God to keep them, even to the end.&quot;
Link
&quot;There is another lessson here. We trust God for eternal things, but we do not dare to trust Him for the material. We say, “Amen, hallelujah, Jesus is my Saviour; I know whom I have believed; hallelujah for salvation” but the moment something goes wrong, all our joy is gone. One of the family gets sick; then we begin to doubt, and cannot trust the Lord any more.&quot;
Link
&quot;Here we have an incident that is tremendous in its lesson. A believer who is out of fellowship with God can do meaner and lower things than the sinner who has never been saved.&quot;
Link
&quot;We have the evidence here that Abram in a moment of doubt showed that the old nature and the old doubts were still present within him: he went down into Egypt. Other Biblical characters had similar experiences. We have but to recall the case of Noah and his drunkenness, David and his sin, Solomon and his wives, Peter and his denial of our Lord. “Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.”&quot;

            <Text>Please read Genesis 13 and answer the following questions:
Context
• What has happened so far in the narrative? Have there been any major events, characters or themes?
• What has happened just prior to the section you are reading?

Observation

What do you learn about the main characters in this section? How does the author describe them? How do they describe themselves?
Moses describes the men of Sodom as wicked and great sinners against the Lord
Abram
Displays faith in God through building and worshipping God at altars
Lot
Displays poor decision-making
Canaanites and Perizzites

Is time or place significant in the events that happen in the passage?

Is there a conflict or high point in the passage?

And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock.
The high point comes with God speaking to Abram to reaffirm His promise in light of his recent decision

Do you think there is a main point or theme in this section of the story?
God honors Abram’s display of faith through the conflict with Lot and his herdsmen. 
in this scene Abraham’s faith in God is so secure that he can extend land to Lot to make peace. In faith and worship, he builds altars to the Lord, and God rewards him with his voice of promise to give him the land. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 220). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.


What surprises are there?
Surprised that Abram did not assert his right to God’s promise to give him Canaan

Meaning

Are there any ‘editorial’ comments from the author about the events in the narrative? How do these comments illuminate what is happening?
The editorial comment in 13:10 foreshadows the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
The editorial comment in 13:13 notes the wickedness of the men of Sodom, which apparently chooses to ignore. These notes highlights Lot’s poor choice. In ch. 14, Lot will be captured as a slave of war.
Does someone in the narrative learn something or grow in some way? How? What does this person learn?
the altars signify Abraham’s return to faith and his proclamation of claiming the land in the name of God. The narrator underscores Abraham’s return to the place of faith and worship by the repetitive phrase “as far as the site where his tent had been earlier, to the site where he had first built an altar” Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001)
What started as a situation of discontent, quarreling, and friction has now turned into one of divine promise and blessing. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). 
How does the passage point forward to what God is going to do in the future? Does it prophesy or anticipate Jesus Christ in some way?
God reaffirms his promise to give Canaan to Abram and to make him a great nation
Included among the offspring of Abram will be Jesus, the incarnate eternal Word.
Abraham, giving up his rights and implicitly risking the Promised Land to the reprobate Moabites and Ammonites (19:37–38; Deut. 23:3–6; Ezra 9:1), by faith inherits forever “all the land” and “an offspring like the dust” (see Gen. 13:15–16). He prefigures Christ, who humbles himself to the cross and then is so highly exalted that every rational being in heaven and earth will bow the knee at his name. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). 
How could you sum up the meaning of this passage in your own words?

Application

How does this passage challenge your understanding about who God is and what he is like?
God’s jurisdiction and sovereignty are not confined to his land. His authority does not stop at the border. He judges an Egyptian Pharaoh for his sins, showing the extension of his power into foreign soil. So too the residents of Sodom may be tagged as “sinners against Yahweh.” Hamilton, V. P. (1990). 
Is there some attitude or behaviour you need to change?
Faith in God gives me the freedom to be generous
Faith in God gives me the freedom to put aside selfish ambition
true Christianity renounces consumerism. Instead, Christians are to relinquish their rights in order to enrich others, trusting God’s promises to provide. Abraham, secure in God, can give up his land. When we are secure in Christ, we do not have to grasp greedily for possessions. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001)
Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Php 2:3). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.
Faith in God gives me the freedom to be a peacemaker
Christians are to give up their rights and prosperity to restore relationship between people. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001).
Only surrendering the heart and will to God creates peace - it is not secured in circumstances, the ideal environment, etc.
The commendation of peacemakers
Mt 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Ro 14:19 So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.
The importance of pursuing peace
Ro 12:18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.

1. Where did the events in this chapter take place (v3)? (Locate this on the map.)

Bethel/Ai
Jordan Valley
Canaan
Sodom/Gomorrah
Hebron

2. What had Abram built at this place (v4)? Describe what this is. (Think: Abram built these in many places. What does this tell us about his character?)

Abram built an altar near Bethel
The physical symbol is a reminder to Abraham of God’s promises and Abraham’s earlier faith. The narrator’s comment on this image suggests to the reader that Abraham has returned to a position of faith, the place where the reader should also dwell. Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001).

3. What problem arose between Lot and Abram and what was the cause of the problem?

Disputing arose between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot due to lack of land space

4. What proposal did Abram make to solve the problem? What does this say about Abram’s character?

He gave Lot the option to choose whatever area he wanted to settle
Abram offers Lot a choice between going “right” or “left” when they separate (Gen 13:9). In biblical geography, “right” often indicates the south, so “left” here would indicate the north (see Wenham 1987, 297).
Giving first choice to Lot was both generous and risky. Commentators usually emphasize Abram’s magnanimity, his noble gesture in giving Lot first choice, as a sign of his renewed trust in Yahweh to fulfill the promise

5. List and explain at least three passages elsewhere that show the importance of peace and making peace. (Think: Under what circumstances may we give in to others to have peace, and under what circumstances would it be wrong to do so?)

The commendation of peacemakers
Mt 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Ro 14:19 So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.

Ro 12:18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
Heb 12:14 Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord
Sometimes brothers must separate for the sake of peace Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001).

6. What choice did Lot make and why?

Lot chose the Jordan Valley, near Sodom
The attraction of the Jordan Valley is made evident in Gen 13:10 where the land is described as “well-watered” like “Egypt” and the “garden of Yahweh.”

7. What were the people like in the area Lot moved to?

The men of Sodom were very wicked
Sodomites, not living in the promised land, are culpable as sinners against Yahweh. Hamilton, V. P. (1990). 

8. Special Assignment: Using cross references, find and explain passages that show what results Lot’s choice eventually brought on him and his family. (Think: What lessons can we learn about the danger of material attractions?)

Lot’s choice to go east represents separation—from Abram, from the promised land, and from God. 
In Genesis, “east” frequently indicates moving in a direction away from God or toward danger (compare the expulsion from Eden in Gen 3:24 or Cain’s exile in Gen 4:16; see Mathews 2005, 130–1; McKeown 2008, 84).
Abram trusts Yahweh for provision, while Lot chooses what appears to be the best land for himself. Like Eve in Gen 3:6, Lot is attracted by the deceptively good appearance of what he sees.
His decision creates a chain of events that will lead to the founding of the Moabites and the Ammonites as distinct peoples in the Transjordan region, outside of Canaan (see Gen 19:30–38).
Lot’s decision making process (allowing himself to be guided by what attracts) will put him in dire circumstances. Lot chooses by sight in contrast to Abram’s faithful choice to trust God. 

9. According to the New Testament, what evidence is there that Melchizedek was greater than Abram?


10. How much of the spoils of war did Abram keep and why? 

Abram kept nothing so that no one could be credited with blessing him besides the Lord, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth

11. Who did keep some of the spoils?

A Living Sacrifice
12 I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. 2 Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

“Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.  The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Mt 5:5). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

 4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. The Holy Bible: English Standard Version. (2016). (Php 2:3–4). Wheaton, IL: Crossway Bibles.

built an altar. Abraham offers a proper response to God’s renewed promises (cf. 12:7–9) and an appropriate conclusion to this scene (see 13:3–4). Waltke, B. K., &amp; Fredricks, C. J. (2001). Genesis: a commentary (p. 223). Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan.

            <Text>Abram and Lot Separate
13 So Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the Negeb. 

2 Now Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold. 3 And he journeyed on from the Negeb as far as Bethel to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 4 to the place where he had made an altar at the first. And there Abram called upon the name of the Lord. 5 And Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents, 6 so that the land could not support both of them dwelling together; for their possessions were so great that they could not dwell together, 7 and there was strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. At that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were dwelling in the land. 

8 Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. 9 Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.” 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) 11 So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan Valley, and Lot journeyed east. Thus they separated from each other. 12 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled among the cities of the valley and moved his tent as far as Sodom. 13 Now the men of Sodom were wicked, great sinners against the Lord. 

14 The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had separated from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, 15 for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your offspring forever. 16 I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if one can count the dust of the earth, your offspring also can be counted. 17 Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.” 18 So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the oaks of Mamre, which are at Hebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.

            <Text>


	Abram &amp; Lot faced a threefold problem

5 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.

a.	An unwise desire: To stay together even when the land could not support both of them

6 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.

b.	A severe conflict between workers
c.	A poor godly influence, a poor testimony to the worldDS1,2

7 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

2.	Abram sought to solve the conflict
a.	He suggested the need for keeping the peace

8 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.

b.	He offered to give the best land to Lot, sacrificing his own right to choose first

9 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thy-self, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.

3.	Lot was misled by the lust of the eyes &amp; by what looked good: By appearance
a.	Selfishly, Lot “lifted up his eyes” to look for the best land
b.	Selfishly, Lot looked &amp; focused his eyes upon what appeared to be the best landDS3
c.	Selfishly, Lot chose all the best land for himself

10 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
11 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

4.	Abram lived where he could prosper spiritually, Lot where he could prosper in the world
a.	Lot settled near Sodom
b.	Lot settled where the people were wicked &amp; very sinful
5.	Abram’s faith was rewarded
a.	When: After separation from the worldly
b.	How: By the Lord’s Word—“Lift up now your eyes”
c.	What: A threefold reward
1)	The land
2)	The seed

12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.
13 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.
14 And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:

3)	The right to claim the land: All the land upon which he walked

15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.

6.	Abram’s faith continued onDS4

16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

a.	He obeyed God
b.	He worshipped God (in Hebron) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 44). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

            <Title>Repentance 13:1-4</Title>
            <Text>5 (13:1–4) Repentance: the fifth step in weak faith is repentance. Every believer who is weak in faith and wanders off needs to repent and return to God. By repenting and returning to God, the believer will, over a period of time, become strong in faith. God always receives the repentant believer and blesses him richly, ever so richly. God always forgives sin, no matter how terrible the sin has been, if the person repents—truly repents—and turns to the Lord and begins to follow Him.

This is exactly what happened to Abram. Note that Abram returned to God and the promised land. He could have returned to Ur of the Chaldees or to Haran or even to some other country and land. Unquestionably, he and Sarah were discouraged and downcast, feeling deep guilt, shame, and embarrassment. They were probably gripped by dread, apprehension, and even some fear, hating to face the members of their household and the laborers of their herds. But Abram and Sarah did exactly what was needed.

a. They separated from Egypt, from the world of ungodliness and worldly lusts (v. 1).

b. They repented and began their journey back to the promised land, to Bethel. Apparently, Pharaoh feared the God of Abram so much that he let Abram keep the gifts he had given for Sarah, hoping to pacify Abram’s God (v. 2). Note that Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.
Bethel was the place where Abram had begun his journey in the promised land and had built an altar for worship (vv. 3–4). All this points to Abram’s repenting and turning back to God. In fact, Scripture clearly says that “Abram called on the name of the Lord.” And when repentant believers call on the Lord—sincerely call—the Lord restores them, even to a more glorious position of blessing and service than before.
“Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord” (Ac. 3:19).
“Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee” (Ac. 8:22).
“If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land” (2 Chr. 7:14).
“Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon” (Is. 55:7).
“But to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word” (Is. 66:2).
“Come, and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up” (Ho. 6:1).

            <Title>Abram Separated from Lot: Selfish Vs. Unselfish</Title>
            <Text>Abram Separated from Lot: Selfish Vs. Unselfish Faith, 13:5–18
(13:5–18) Introduction: Abram treated Lot like a son. Lot was Abram’s nephew. When Lot’s father, Haran, died, Abram took Lot in and reared him just as he would his own son. But as we shall see, Lot paid little attention to spiritual matters. This is what this passage is all about. The passage draws a sharp contrast between Lot and Abram, between a carnal, worldly believer and a spiritual believer. It gives us a picture of unselfish faith vs. selfish faith.
⇒	Abram lived by faith; Lot lived by sight (Ge. 13:8–9; 13:10–11).
⇒	Abram was giving and unselfish; Lot was greedy and selfish (Ge. 13:8–9; 13:10–11).
⇒	Abram was humble and respectful; Lot was prideful and self-exalting (Ge. 13:8–9; 13:10–11).
⇒	Abram sought after God and His promises; Lot sought after the bright lights, possessions, and pleasures of this world (Ge. 13:14–18; 13:10–11).
⇒	Abram was spiritually minded; Lot was worldly minded (Ge. 13:8, 12; 13:10–12).
⇒	Abram looked for the heavenly city that is eternal, whose builder and maker is God; Lot looked for a worldly city that was built by man and offered the wealth, position, and bright lights of the world (He. 11:10, 13–16; Ge. 13:12–13).
⇒	Abram became the father of all who believe (Ro. 4:11); Lot became the father of only two daughters who brought utter disgrace to his name (Ge. 19:33–38).
⇒	Abram was made “heir of the world” (Ro. 4:13); Lot lost all his possessions in the fiery destruction of Sodom living the latter years of his life in a cave (Ge. 19:30).

            <Text>Leadership Ministries Notes on Genesis 13

Remember: Lot was the son of Abram’s brother, Haran. When Haran died, Abram took Lot into his household. Thus, when Abram left Ur of the Chaldees for the promised land, Lot went with him (see Ge. 11:31). We know from Scripture that Lot himself, at some point, became a believer and began to follow after God and His promises. But Lot lived a carnal life, an extremely carnal and worldly life (2 Pe. 2:7–8; see note—Ge. 19:1–38 for more discussion). The first sight of his carnality and love for the world shows itself in this passage. Obviously, Lot had become a wealthy young man through the years while he was with his uncle, Abram. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 45). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verse 6
However, the situation was now critical: there just was not enough good pasture to handle the large herds and flocks of the two ranchers. No matter how much they wanted to stay together, no matter how close their relationship, they needed to separate. Abram in particular recognized this. He was the one who was to suggest separating; this will be seen in just a moment. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 45). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verse 7

b. Problem two: a conflict between the workers of the two men was being waged over the best pasture land and water holes. Note that the conflict was not between Abram and Lot; it was only between their laborers. The two men had not yet been drawn into the conflict; their relationship had not yet been affected. But Abram was wise enough to know that petty arguments and conflicts eventually affect everyone unless they are squelched in the beginning.

c. Problem three: Abram and Lot were about to become a poor testimony to the world (v. 7). Note that the Canaanites and Perizzites were living in the same area. This means they were watching the conflict between the workers of Abram and Lot, probably wondering how the two large sheiks (ranchers) would solve the problem. It was just a poor testimony for men of the true God to allow a situation to exist that would cause severe conflict. Remember: one of the very purposes for God choosing Abram was for Abram to bear witness to the other nations, witness that there is only one living and true God, only one Savior and hope for man. Thus Abram knew that he faced a unique opportunity to bear witness to the surrounding neighbors. How he handled the situation would give either a strong witness or a weak witness for God.

 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 45). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verses 8-9

a. First, Abram suggested the need for keeping peace between them and their workers. They were brothers and brothers should not fight; brothers should care for each other and look after each other. Abram knew that all kinds of trials and enemies were going to confront them as they followed God and sought the promised land. They were going to need one another; thus they needed to be at peace and ready to help when help was needed. The trials and enemies of life are just too great for brothers not to stand together against whatever confronts them. Abram knew this; thus he stepped forward to suggest peace before the conflict erupted into a crisis.


b. Second, Abram offered to give the best pasture land to Lot, offered to sacrifice his right to claim the best for himself (v. 9). Abram had the right to choose first, and he deserved that right.
⇒	He was the older, the head of the family
⇒	He was the person to whom God had promised the land
⇒	He was the leader, the one who had led the pilgrims to the promised land
But Abram did an astounding thing: he offered the first choice of land to Lot. Abram gave up his claim to choose first. By this he illustrates perfectly what it means …
•	to act unselfishly
•	to give sacrificially
•	to be humble and meek

 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 45–46). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Abram had great faith in God. He had learned this lesson in the famine experience when he failed to trust God’s provision and went down into Egypt for help (Ge. 13:10f). Abram had learned that God would take care of him, that God expected the true believer to trust Him. Thus, Abram was now willing to seek God and His righteousness above all else, willing to trust God to take care of him even if Lot acted selfishly and usurped Abram’s rights and chose the best pasture land for himself. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 46). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verses 10-11

Selfishly, Lot “lifted up his eyes” to look for the best region of the land. Lot jumped at the chance to get the best region. The idea is that he immediately lifted up his eyes and began to survey the land to see where the most watered and fertile region was. This should not have been the first thing he did, but it was. Lot was selfish and greedy. How can we say this? Because he should have “lifted up his eyes” to Abram, the man of God and the head of the family, and insisted that he choose first. But Lot did not do this; in fact, there is no record that he even thanked or showed appreciation to Abram for the privilege of choosing first. Lot simply “lifted up his eyes” and immediately began to survey the land, looking for the very best land to claim. Lot was filled with selfishness and greed, wanting the very best for himself despite the fact that the right to choose first belonged to Abram.
Thought 1. What a selfish act! Keep in mind that Abram had taken Lot in and treated him like a son when Lot’s father died. Abram reared Lot, educated him and got him started in business. Most likely, Lot owed everything to Abram. Yet here Lot was usurping the right of Abram by failing to acknowledge Abram’s position and contribution to his life. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 47). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
It was the land that had given rise to the infamous, ungodly cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Note that the cities still existed; God had not yet destroyed them. Lot, no doubt, knew of their ungodliness; yet he was still considering the Jordan Valley.
Thought 1. Lot ignored the ungodly behavior of Sodom and Gomorrah. In blindness, he must have denied that their ungodliness would influence the spiritual life of his dear family.
c. Selfishly, Lot chose all the best land for himself. He chose the whole plain of the Jordan River.
⇒	He selfishly chose the whole region, refusing to offer Abram at least part of the fertile plain of Jordan.
⇒	He foolishly chose the region where ungodliness flourished.
⇒	He selfishly chose material wealth over the safety of his family’s salvation and spiritual growth.
Thought 1. Note two striking lessons.
(1)	People move for all kinds of reasons: seeking a better position, job, scenery, more money, a larger house, and on and on the reasons could go. When believers move, they must always look at the spiritual impact of the move:
⇒	the number of fellow believers within an area
⇒	the availability of Bible centered churches that really preach Christ
⇒	the moral and spiritual atmosphere of the community, schools, businesses, and institutions of the area
⇒	the worldly places that exist to tempt the children
(2)	We must never be misled by appearance, by the lust of the eyes, and by what looks good. There is far more to life than the physical and material, far more than the bright lights, pleasures, possessions, positions, and wealth of this world. The things of this world do not satisfy the human soul: they leave the soul empty, dissatisfied, and unfulfilled. The only thing that satisfies the human soul is God and the things of God, things such as purpose, meaning, and significance; things such as love, joy, peace, goodness, faith, discipline, and control. The fulness of life comes only from God and from God alone; therefore, the major decisions of life must be made in light of God. What kind of decisions?
•	where to live
•	where to work
•	where to go to school
•	where to go for recreation
•	where to worship
•	who to marry
•	who to fellowship with
•	who to date
•	what movies and TV programs to watch
•	what to wear and how to dress
Every decision we make in life should be made by considering God, by considering the impact it will have on our spiritual growth and testimony for Him. Lot failed to do this; we must not. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 47–48). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verses 12-13
Abram lived where he could prosper spiritually; Lot lived where he could prosper within the world, where he could secure the world’s possessions and enjoy its bright lights and pleasures. Abram continued his pilgrimage of faith: he refused to settle down, moving all around the land of Canaan

 Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 48). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

But this was not all: Lot decided to settle down, and the place he chose for a home site was the worst place of all, near Sodom. What would make Lot do this? Money, greed, business—wanting the pleasures and possessions of the earth. The cities were just what they are today: places where the biggest markets for business transactions are.
⇒	The cities had all kinds of markets for gold, silver, sheep, goats, camels, cattle, and other commodities. Lot, just as any businessman, needed these markets to keep his business flourishing and growing.
⇒	The cities had all kinds of pleasures and possessions. Lot and his family desired the bright lights, pleasures, and possessions of the world. (Evidence of this is Lot’s wife: she just could not break away from Sodom and its pleasures, even at the risk of losing her life [Ge. 19:15–26]).
⇒	The cities also offered the opportunity for worldly position, honor, and recognition. Lot would later seek position and honor from the world. This is indicated by the fact that Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom when judgment was about to fall upon Sodom. Sitting at the gate of a city was reserved only for city officials. The city gate was where city officials met to conduct the business of the city. At some point in time, Lot became a city official of Sodom (Ge. 19:1).
Now, what was wrong with Lot doing business within the cities of the land? Nothing. Abram, no doubt, transacted business within the cities of Canaan as well. He had to, for it was the only way he had to grow and increase his business holdings, and Scripture is clear: Abram had large holdings; he was very rich in gold, silver, and herds (Ge. 13:2). The wrong committed by Lot was this: he became part of the world. He not only lived in the world, he participated in its worldly pleasures and sins, its greed and wickedness. Lot moved right in with the worldly and ungodly of this earth.

Verse 14-17
Note when God spoke to Abram: after he had separated from worldly Lot. But God knew Lot’s heart, that Lot craved the worldliness of this earth, the bright lights, position, possessions and pleasures he had seen in the cities. Did Abram know that Lot had a worldly heart, that he was lusting after the things of this world? Scripture does not say. Thus God had to stir Abram to separate from Lot so that God could bless Abram. Scripture declares that God does not pour out His blessing upon a believer when he is unequally yoked with a worldly person (see 2 Co. 6:14–18). Once Lot was separated from Abram, God could then speak to Abram and meet his need.
Thought 1. God’s presence and power are only available to those who are …
•	set apart—separated—from the world and the lust after its bright lights, pleasures, and possessions

•	set apart—separated—unto God, wholly given over to Him, to seeking Him and His promises Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 49). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.
Note how God rewarded Abram’s faith: by His Word, by a vision of His great promises. God gave Abram strong assurance, a glorious vision of the promises. God told Abram to lift up his eyes, to look as far as the eye could see, and to look in every direction: north, south, east, and west. Note that Lot had also lifted up his eyes and looked, but there was a vast difference in what the two men saw (v. 10). Lot and Abram both lifted up their eyes and looked:
⇒	Lot lifted up his eyes to the world, but Abram lifted up his eyes to the promised land.
⇒	Lot lifted up his eyes in self-sufficiency, but Abram lifted up his eyes in trust.
⇒	Lot lifted up his eyes with a selfish, greedy desire for gain; Abram lifted up his eyes with a giving, sacrificial desire for unity.
⇒	Lot lifted up his eyes from an uncommitted, worldly heart; Abram lifted up his eyes from a committed, spiritual heart.
c. Note the threefold reward given to Abram. This was the third time God reaffirmed His covenant with Abram.
1)	The reward of the promised land (v. 15. See note—Ge. 12:1c for discussion.)
2)	The reward of the promised seed (v. 15. See note—Ge. 12:2–3 for discussion.) Note that the seed, the descendents, of Abram are to number as the sand by the seashore. This simply means that the grains of sand are so many they cannot be numbered, so Abram’s descendents down through the ages will be so many they will not be able to be numbered.
3)	The reward of being able to claim the land (v. 17). Very simply, God told Abram to arise and walk throughout the land, throughout the length and breadth of it, and to claim every place his foot stepped. Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, pp. 49–50). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

Verse 18

Stedfastness—Obedience: Abram’s faith continued on. Abram obeyed God and worshipped God. The idea is that he did just what God said: he moved about as a pilgrim, claiming the land wherever he went.
Note that Abram settled down for a while by the great trees of Mambre in Hebron. Mambre was the name of the man (an Amorite) after whom the area was named (see Ge. 14:13).
⇒	Note that Abram also built an altar in Hebron. This altar was both for worship and for a testimony to the surrounding people, a witness to the only living and true God. (See note, Altar—Ge. 12:7–9.) Leadership Ministries Worldwide. (1996). Genesis (Chapters 12–50) (Vol. II, p. 50). Chattanooga, TN: Leadership Ministries Worldwide.

They acknowledge that their riches come from God 
1 Ch 29:12 
1 Chronicles 29:12 (ESV) — 12 Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. 
See also Ec 5:19–20 
Ecclesiastes 5:19–20 (ESV) — 19 Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil—this is the gift of God. 20 For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart. 
They devote their riches to God’s service 
Pr 3:9–10

1 Chronicles 29:1–9 (ESV) — 1 And David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the palace will not be for man but for the Lord God. 2 So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble. 3 Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God: 4 3,000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house, 5 and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the Lord?” 6 Then the leaders of fathers’ houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king’s work. 7 They gave for the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents of iron. 8 And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord, in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9 Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the Lord. David the king also rejoiced greatly. 
Acts 4:32–37 (ESV) — 32 Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. 33 And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. 34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold 35 and laid it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need. 36 Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, 37 sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.

Examples of peacemakers 
Ge 13:8–9 Abraham; 1 Sa 25:14–31 Abigail; Es 10:3 Mordecai; Is 53:5 the suffering servant 
Genesis 13:8–9 (ESV) — 8 Then Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. 9 Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the right hand, then I will go to the left.” 
1 Samuel 25:14–31 (ESV) — 14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master, and he railed at them. 15 Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them. 16 They were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 17 Now therefore know this and consider what you should do, for harm is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is such a worthless man that one cannot speak to him.” 18 Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two skins of wine and five sheep already prepared and five seahs of parched grain and a hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys. 19 And she said to her young men, “Go on before me; behold, I come after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 20 And as she rode on the donkey and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her, and she met them. 21 Now David had said, “Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good. 22 God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him.” 23 When Abigail saw David, she hurried and got down from the donkey and fell before David on her face and bowed to the ground. 24 She fell at his feet and said, “On me alone, my lord, be the guilt. Please let your servant speak in your ears, and hear the words of your servant. 25 Let not my lord regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name, and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent. 26 Now then, my lord, as the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, because the Lord has restrained you from bloodguilt and from saving with your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal. 27 And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord. 28 Please forgive the trespass of your servant. For the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the Lord, and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live. 29 If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the Lord your God. And the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling. 30 And when the Lord has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you and has appointed you prince over Israel, 31 my lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience for having shed blood without cause or for my lord working salvation himself. And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord, then remember your servant.”

            <Title>Meekness</Title>
            <Text>Meekness

5. Now the meek come in for attention (JB and REB have “gentle”). Meekness is another word for self-effacement. We should not miss the point that in all three of the opening beatitudes the truth is brought out that the follower of Jesus does not aggressively insist on his own rights but displays genuine humility. Meekness is not to be confused with weakness: the meek are not simply submissive because they lack the resources to be anything else. Meekness is quite compatible with great strength and ability as humans measure strength, but whatever strength or weakness the meek person has is accompanied by humility and a genuine dependence on God. True meekness may be a quality of the strong, those who could assert themselves but choose not to do so. The strong who qualify for this blessing are the strong who decline to domineer. Self-assertion is never a Christian virtue; rather, it is Christian to be busy in lowly service and to refuse to engage in the conduct that merely advances one’s personal aims.

The reward of the meek is that they will inherit the earth (cf. Ps. 37:11). The verb points to firm possession; clearly there is no thought here of inheriting on the death of a testator or the like. There may be a reference to the psalm that contrasts the wicked, who “will be no more,” with the meek, who “shall possess the land” (Ps. 37:10–11). The sense in which they will do this is not obvious. Tolstoy and others have spoken of “the terrible meek” apparently because there are so many of the downtrodden that in the end the strong are not able to budge the inert mass and accomplish what they want to get done. But it is impossible to think that Jesus’ meaning is anything like that. Rather, the thought is eschatological; Jesus is looking forward to the coming of the messianic kingdom. In the end it is the meek, not the self-assertive, who will have a place in God’s kingdom. It has often been pointed out that the future in this and the following verses indicates certainty and not simply futurity. Morris, L. (1992). The Gospel according to Matthew (p. 98).
